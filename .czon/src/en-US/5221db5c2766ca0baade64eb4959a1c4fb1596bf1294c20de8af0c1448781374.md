"title": "A Few Words After Setting Up the Blog"
"summary": "This article documents the author's complete process of building a personal blog over two days after the 2017 Lunar New Year. Initially dissatisfied with the limitations of the JianShu platform and inspired by a friend's blog, the author chose the Hexo framework and deployed it to GitHub Pages. During the setup, the author explored from manual deployment to discovering the Travis CI automated build solution, ultimately achieving a more convenient way to update the blog. The article not only shares technical details but also reflects on holiday learning habits, the joy of technical exploration, and the life lesson of 'perseverance' through three sections: 'The Reason Behind It,' 'Hands-On Research,' and 'Full of Insights,' emphasizing the value of steady persistence."

It took me two days to set up my own blog, and now I'm full of insights, wanting to share three points.

## The Reason Behind It

After returning home on January 25th, I joyfully celebrated the New Year.

I have a flaw: I absolutely cannot study when I'm home on vacation. Back in high school, homework occasionally kept me in check on weekends, but now I'm completely unrestrained. However, I couldn't just let myself mess around at home every day. While habits are hard to change, people are adaptable. So, as soon as the New Year festivities were mostly over after the eighth day of the lunar month, I escaped from my own clutches and returned to school. The lab has one advantage: no matter how comfortable the environment is, I can muster the willpower not to switch back to Windows to play games.

After returning to school, I made some changes to my half-dead website and started thinking about the personal blog I'd been eyeing for a long time. Previously, because [JianShu](http://www.jianshu.com/) supported markdown, I eagerly registered. After writing a couple of casual essays, I still felt there were too many restrictions and not enough freedom—call it nitpicking if you will. Seeing [Azheng's blog](https://zccz14.com/) thriving, I immediately felt I needed to learn a thing or two.

## Hands-On Research

Actually, Azheng had written a tutorial: [*Elegantly Using Hexo*](https://zccz14.com/2016/12/30/%E4%BC%98%E9%9B%85%E5%9C%B0%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8Hexo/); it was very detailed, and following it step by step would quickly get the blog set up. But initially, I didn't notice it, so I dove in with full enthusiasm to figure things out on my own.

Because of the above, I decided not to write another tutorial myself. Instead, I'll simply record my **journey of thoughts**, adding links where appropriate.

First, I noticed the Hexo blog framework. After a night of research, I set up the Hexo blog, installed the NexT theme, configured it myself, deployed it to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and set up domain name resolution.

At this point, the blog was fully set up, and I could have stopped here. But I still felt that manually generating and publishing updates for this static blog was a bit cumbersome. I wanted to see if there was a way to make this already convenient solution even more convenient—basically, I was lazy, incredibly lazy. ~~But then again, isn't the world able to progress because lazy people want to make their laziness more comfortable?~~

Then I discovered a pinned blog post by the initiator of NexT (the theme), discussing whether Travis CI's automated build and continuous integration service—a boon to humanity—could be used to automatically update the blog. But since I had to wake up early the next morning, I first migrated two articles from my JianShu account to fill this beautiful vase and went to bed early.

Yesterday, I spent the whole day playing and didn't touch this. Today, back in the lab, I continued tinkering. Suddenly, I discovered Azheng's tutorial on using Travis for automated builds. It was on a whole other level, truly impressive:

> - Quick Deployment  
>   Leveraging Git's characteristics, keep version-controlled files small and numerous, containing only source code.
> - Automated Deployment  
>   No need to manually use `hexo deploy` for deployment. Just push the source code to GitHub, and it will deploy automatically.
> - No Installation Required  
>   You can write/publish blog posts even without a node.js environment, Hexo command-line tools, or even Git.

At this point, I was satisfied with setting up my blog.

## Full of Insights

Afterward, as the concluding remarks for the inaugural article to celebrate the blog's launch, I wanted to use this silly-sounding phrase I coined an hour ago as the title for this section, expressing the little insights I've gained.

New Year, new beginnings! This is also the first article after the Lunar New Year.

Earlier, I spent three days frantically learning linear algebra from scratch for an exam. Every day, I marveled: if only I could work this hard every day in my daily life. As the saying goes, "A swift steed cannot cover ten paces in one leap, but a slow horse can travel far through perseverance." This is probably an example, and I'm no swift steed.

In fact, this should be a lifelong goal for me: perseverance.

Hold onto hope and walk steadily forward.
