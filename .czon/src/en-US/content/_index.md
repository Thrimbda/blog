## Hello

I've finally mustered up some interest to renovate my long-neglected blog.

In 2024, my life has reached a stage where the urge to express myself can be quickly and easily satisfied offline. Although there are still many things I want to write about sometimes, spending time writing articles feels a bit like a luxury to me. So, I've been too lazy to maintain my own blog. Coincidentally, the CI for Hexo broke down, so I took this opportunity to switch to a new one.

And that's here.

After briefly looking into NextJS, Gatsby, and Hexo, to avoid wasting this fleeting desire to tinker with a blog, I ultimately chose Zola, a single-binary static site generator. I didn't do any in-depth research, but it genuinely meets my current needs:

1.  Write in Markdown.
2.  As long as this binary exists, I should still be able to publish via CI ten years from now, without build failures due to outdated dependencies (yes, I'm looking at you, Hexo).
3.  The theme is simple enough that even I can easily maintain it.

Maybe in the future, if I have time to tinker, I'll try to create a more flexible and flashy blog. But for now, this is it.

Looking back at an article I wrote years ago when I first set up my blog, it still feels quite interesting, so I'll leave it here.

> After returning to school and tweaking my half-dead website, I started thinking about the personal blog I've been eyeing for a long time. I used to be excited about JianShu because it supported markdown, so I rushed to register. After writing a couple of casual essays, I still felt there were too many restrictions, too little freedom—you could say I was nitpicking. Seeing A-Zheng's blog[^1] thriving, I immediately felt that I, Tu Yang, still needed to learn a thing or two.

## Footnotes

[^1]: A-Zheng said: "Who keeps a diary these days?!" Although the link to his blog is now dead, fortunately, he's lazy enough that he didn't bother deleting the source code. So, if you're interested, you can still take a look: [zccz14's Blog](https://github.com/zccz14/blog/tree/master/src/posts), but who knows if it'll still be there after he sees this post.
