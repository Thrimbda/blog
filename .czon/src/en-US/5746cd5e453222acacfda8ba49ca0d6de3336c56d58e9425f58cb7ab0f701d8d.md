Borrowed an image to set the tone for this piece.
Why did I choose such a title? Because on my way back to the lab from Kangqiao after dinner today, the scene stirred my emotions, and I felt compelled to express my thoughts.

## The Heaviest Snow Since University (Or Not)

> Actually, the snowfall on January 31st this year was heavier.

I stayed overnight in the lab the night before last. Since the room is equipped with heating and air conditioning, and we almost never open the windows, it was quite warm. Only when I stepped out to use the restroom did I notice it was a bit colder than usual. It was dark, so I didn’t think much of it.

—It wasn’t until I woke up shivering the next morning that I slowly realized it had snowed.
The snow fell all day, only stopping around 11 p.m.

Unfortunately, I stayed overnight in the lab to meet a noon deadline today, so I spent the entire snowy day indoors. It wasn’t until I finished my work in the evening that I decided to return to my dorm for a night’s rest. The night snack vendors deserve praise for their dedication, braving the cold night to set up their stalls. I decided to support their efforts.

And so, the beautiful snowy scenery was ~~_wasted_~~ missed by me.

## More Interesting Than the Snow Are the Excited Southerners

> The above line is meant in jest.

I personally enjoy expressing reflections, often moved by scenes to ponder and sigh.

Last year, a classmate invited me to the Big Wild Goose Pagoda. After the music fountain show ended, the bustling square quickly emptied. Gazing at the ancient pagoda, I felt deeply moved:
It has stood here quietly for a thousand years. In comparison, a human life is so short. ~~And as lonely as snow~~
Suddenly, a profound sense of history washed over me, and I was left awestruck, savoring the flood of emotions.

We are moved by scenes likely because something resonates within us. As Marco Polo described the city of Phyllida to Kublai Khan:

> If you find one of the two arcades more pleasant, it’s because thirty years ago a girl in an embroidered skirt and wide sleeves passed by there, or because the light in that arcade at a certain moment reminds you of another arcade somewhere else.

## Like an Audience, Watching Someone Else’s Life

> I felt quite sad after returning that day. Why?

I love talking big, discussing life and ideals—it’s exhilarating!
Sitting comfortably in a café, pontificating and lamenting the past and present, is certainly carefree. But if, afterward, one fails to **internalize the heart and express it through action**, like the musician Shi Wen learning the qin, then it’s nothing but idleness.
I’d like to echo Zhu Ziqing and say: This year I am twenty, and I am truly too clever.

**Without any accumulation, what is there to reflect upon?**
In high school, I enjoyed criticizing the country and the education system, calling them factories mass-producing fools.
But upon second thought, being such a cynic and making such remarks wouldn’t change the country or education in the slightest. The only thing it achieves is venting dissatisfaction, then continuing to drift in a sea of suffering, making no progress, and becoming one of the aforementioned fools.

After recounting all the cities he had visited, Polo summarized to the Khan:

> The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together.
> There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: **seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.**

In fact, both passages above were spoken by Italo Calvino through Polo’s voice.

## The Greatness of a University Lies in Its Culture

> This is a quote from Lu Xun, as recounted by my high school chemistry teacher.

**John Henry Newman, the Bishop of Oxford and initiator of the Oxford Movement, stated in his famous lecture “The Idea of a University”:**

> Gentlemen, if I had to choose between a university where professors oversaw students and graduation required earning enough credits, and a university without professors or exams where young people lived together, learning from each other for three or four years, I would unhesitatingly choose the latter… Why? I think this way: When many intelligent, curious, compassionate, and perceptive young people gather, even without being taught, they can learn from each other. They exchange ideas, encounter new perspectives, see fresh things, and develop unique judgment.”

_Although Xi’an Jiaotong University follows the former system, it still shines, to some extent, with the brilliance of the latter._

After dinner, I stepped out of Kangqiao and exhaled a few breaths of mist. Though the day was cold, it was mealtime, and the area outside the cafeteria was bustling, with soft music playing over the speakers.
As I walked through the crowd, I overheard snippets of conversation—some discussing their latest research directions, others debating a mechanics problem, and still others talking about the design of something… I felt a touch of emotion and finally realized that most of the people before me were future artists, scientists, and engineers.

Despite being a season of withering after heavy snow, I witnessed an unprecedented vitality.

**How fortunate! Let me sing to express my aspirations.**

## Postscript

Having survived the deadline, I breathed a sigh of relief and wrote this piece.
