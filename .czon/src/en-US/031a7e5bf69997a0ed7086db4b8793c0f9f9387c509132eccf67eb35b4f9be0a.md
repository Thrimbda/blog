"title": "Analysis of Keats' Poem 'To -'"
"summary": "This article centers on Keats' poem 'To -', first introducing the emotional background of Keats being deeply moved by a brief encounter with a young lady, and presenting the complete original text of the poem. The poem expresses the poet's profound longing for this lady, conveying his emotions through natural imagery such as the midnight sky, roses, and flowers. The article further points out that the last two lines of the poem bear a striking resemblance in their rhythmic treatment to Shakespeare's sonnets, citing lines from Shakespeare's 'Sonnet CXIII' for comparison. It also mentions that a footnote to Keats' poem once commented on its similarity to Shakespeare's style in terms of emotional structure and musicality, thereby exploring Keats' rhythmic borrowings and emotional expression in his poetic creation."

## To -

```
TIME’S sea hath been five years at its slow ebb,
  Long hours have to and fro let creep the sand,
Since I was tangled in thy beauty’s web,
  And snared by the ungloving of thine hand.

And yet I never look on midnight sky,
  But I behold thine eyes’ well memoried light;
I cannot look upon the rose’s dye,
  But to thy cheek my soul doth take its flight.

I cannot look on any budding flower,
  But my fond ear, in fancy at thy lips
And harkening for a love-sound, doth devour
  Its sweets in the wrong sense:—Thou dost eclipse

Every delight with sweet remembering,
And grief unto my darling joys dost bring.
```

### Notes

Later, I discovered that the last two lines of this poem, `To - ["Time's sea"]`:

```
Every delight with sweet remembering,
And grief unto my darling joys dost bring.
```

bear a rhythmic resemblance to these lines from Shakespeare's `Sonnet CXIII`:

```
Even so, being full of your ne'er cloying sweetness,
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding.
```

No wonder a footnote to Keats' poem once noted, "In the rhythmic handling of emotional structure and the gradually intensifying musicality, it closely resembles Shakespeare's sonnets."
