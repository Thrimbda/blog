During those pleasant and intoxicating seven days in Chengdu three summers ago, I probably never imagined I would return to this city in less than four years.

With what kind of mood, carrying what kind of burdens, and intending to pursue what kind of aspirations.

<!--more-->

I had heard as early as the freshman orientation that the Software School had practical training in the junior year, which would take place in Kunshan or Chengdu. Time flew, and soon during the winter break of my junior year, I received the news that we were going to Chengdu.

My study plans for the winter break were never properly implemented. By now, I had only finished reading *The Mythical Man-Month*. Most of my productive work time was spent on that annoying personal project, which still isn't completely finished. I guess I fell into the so-called "tar pit." But then again, the time wasn't entirely wasted. Working on a project is better than playing games and regretting it later—that's what I think.

## The Trip to Chengdu

Speaking of Chengdu, the impression it gives to an outsider like me is that of a foodie's paradise, a leisure capital, the Land of Abundance. But I'm not much of a foodie, so from that perspective, Chengdu doesn't hold much appeal for me. However, during the summer after high school, I had promised a classmate to travel together—to be a good sport—so we went. After checking flight prices, we found tickets to Chongqing were very cheap, so we decided to play in Chongqing for two days first, then take a high-speed train to Chengdu. Eating and drinking along the way, it felt no different from what I had imagined. I did get a real glimpse of the laid-back lifestyle of Chengdu locals. Sometimes, seeing elderly Chengdu residents strolling leisurely on the streets, my own mood would relax too. Unfortunately, back then my mind was elsewhere, always thinking about other things, so that trip didn't feel quite real.

So now, there's no sense of novelty left. I haven't attached any unrealistic expectations to this training trip in private. My only hope is that I can calm my mind and focus.

Apart from almost going to the wrong train station (a place called Xi'an South Station that I had never been to before), the journey went smoothly overall. Our group of six arrived in this relaxed city just like that.

Our destination was in the northwest of Chengdu, in the suburbs of Pi County. I was told it would take about two hours by car, and I fully expected it to be some desolate place. We got off the train a little after 6 PM. At the station, an uncle followed us from the moment we exited, trying to get his first fare of the day. We were so annoyed that we gave in to his wish—25 yuan per person for the six of us to get to our stop, which was reasonable.

**And thus, I witnessed the prowess of Chengdu drivers.**

Dozens of traffic lights, and the driver uncle, taking advantage of the still-dark sky, didn't stop at a single one. A seven-seater business van, speeding along at 80 km/h without a hint of fear—even wilder than Xi'an's taxi drivers.

Upon arrival, I found it much prettier than I had imagined. It didn't feel like a county town at all, more like a big city with towering buildings.

### About Jingrong Town

After living here for a few days, I found this place quite strange, with an eerie feeling—so few people, yet everywhere filled with adrenaline-pumping encouragement for entrepreneurship: giant banners with photos of Ma Yun, Lei Jun, Li Yanhong, even Steve Jobs and Bill Gates hanging on roadside high-rises. A single block actually had three coffee shops. It all felt very earnest.

So, filled with curiosity, I searched on Zhihu and found these results:

- [Jingrong Town, Chengdu's first entrepreneurial-themed town. Will it become the next Zhongguancun?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/38584390)
- [How do you evaluate the current state and future trends of Chengdu's internet industry?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/38545586)

In summary, it's a modern town built in response to the national "mass entrepreneurship" call, rising from former Foxconn properties. Currently in its early development stage, the government has set up the infrastructure and now offers quite good benefits to attract investment and businesses, aiming to develop it into an incubation base for entrepreneurial talent/companies. This is related to the new development policies of Chengdu's new mayor, with the ultimate goal of becoming the next Zhongguancun, or even the next Silicon Valley.

But I also think entrepreneurship requires both environment and methodology; you can't just rely on pumping adrenaline all the time. As for what this place will become in the future, we'll have to wait and see.

## New Semester, "New Atmosphere"

I thought coming here would mean an excellent internet speed, a comfortable environment, and a personal workstation for everyone. Who knew we'd still have to attend classes, the dormitory has no internet, and the internet speed in the classroom is terrible.

In such an environment, I perfectly missed the re-enrollment for Probability Theory and the sign-up for Software Project Management :) (just by one hour).

As for why I have one retake and one make-up exam: the former is because I slacked off during a deferred exam, didn't study seriously, failed, and thus lost the chance to even take the regular exam; the latter is because I missed too many classes and was barred from the exam. But looking on the bright side, my university experience is now complete :)

Ultimately, it's because I don't know what's on my mind all day, just not paying attention to my own affairs. So, suffering losses is pretty much routine for me.

Missing the sign-up, given the increasingly strict school management these days, probably means "see you next semester."

Anyway, live and learn.

## Back to the Main Topic

The main purpose of coming to Chengdu this time is for the practical training, aiming to learn some practical knowledge: developing software with standard, regulated processes.

Having had that not-so-successful experience with freelance work before, I came here all ears this time, genuinely wanting to learn something with an open mind.

But according to the requirements, we can only do Java development. This means I can't continue the [Orange-Juice](https://github.com/function-x/Orange-Juice) project I was working on with a classmate. So, we had to regroup. My roommates were insistent that I stay with them, so I'll suppress that little bit of regret—after all, what does it matter what we work on? The important thing is to be serious about it.

So—clear away the distractions. The mistakes made are in the past. It's time to calm down and settle in for this month.

I heard it snowed again in Xi'an. Here in Chengdu, it rained. The air is damp, carrying a hint of chill.

I hope I can move forward quietly, one step at a time.
