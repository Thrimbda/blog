"title": "A Special Skill for the Lively Ones"
"summary": "This article is a dedicatory preface in which the author reflects on high school learning experiences through the examples of two classmates, J and Y, contemplating the two extreme learning attitudes of 'thinking without learning' and 'learning without thinking.' J was intelligent but arrogant, falling into the trap of thinking without learning; Y was diligent but rigid, representing the laziness of learning without thinking. The author emphasizes that true learning requires the integration of thinking and learning to avoid becoming a tragic figure. The article aims to guide readers to self-reflection rather than preach, concluding with a shared encouragement from *The Art of War*: 'One who harbors thunder in the chest yet maintains a calm countenance is worthy of being appointed a great general.'"

Updated on 2017-02-05:

A few days ago, I happened to meet a senior who also attended the same university as me. During our casual chat, he asked which high school I went to. I said, "Huanghe." He exclaimed in surprise, "Then you must have been the top scorer at your school!"

Since starting university, I've been asked this question many times by local Xi'an classmates. The responses are either similar exclamations or simply not knowing about the high school.

Actually, I wish I could say, "I was the bottom of my class in high school."

## Explanation of the Title

The title contains two very colloquial terms: **lively ones** and **special skill**. Although those who understand will understand, I still feel it necessary to explain, as a matter of responsibility.

These terms carry a strong personal touch—they were catchphrases of my high school homeroom teacher, Old Cao. Having studied under Old Cao, you'd probably hear such phrases countless times over the three long years. Yet, even three years after graduation, I dare not say I've mastered them. It's more like standing at the doorway, peeking in with my head. As for **what door it is, and what constitutes a door**, I hope you'll ponder carefully.

This piece is dedicated to all the juniors from high school.

## Self-Introduction

Due to a certain incomplete professional habit, I don't want to overly restrict the readers of this article, nor will I make more limiting assumptions about them than I do for my juniors—I shouldn't be your senior who's three years older, nor six years older.

With this in mind, I hope you simply see me as the **basic**, **label-free** **person** I describe—I hope you clearly understand the purpose of my writing this article.

## Sima Zhao's Intentions

As for why I wrote this article, I struggled for a long time but could never find a proper reason to give it as a dedicatory preface to others. We are so contradictory: how capable must one be to have the qualification to stand at a certain height and educate others? **They neither need such qualifications nor could ever reach the level of having them.**

So, I simply stopped considering the issue of qualifications. I wrote because of a long-hidden impulse within me to share life experiences. But deep down, I feel that by telling you, I can summarize and account for (my past) self: mutual benefit is not a bad thing.

## Among Any Three People, There Is Always a Teacher

In high school, I considered myself exceptionally clever, so to this day, I've never admired anyone solely for their intelligence. Still, I enjoy interacting with smart people because communication is easier. **But back then, I didn't understand the difference between being clever and being young.**

In my first year of high school, there was a classmate we called J.

J's mind was incredibly sharp, to the point where even I thought he was clever back then. Where there's brilliance, there's mutual appreciation. High school textbooks are one-sided and full of holes (knowledge gaps), especially in physics, chemistry, and biology—almost every page had questions hinted at but not explained. So, we'd take these questions to the teachers' office next door to bother them—a highly commendable learning attitude. Sometimes, the teachers would think for a moment and give us the answer; other times, they'd brush us off with excuses like `"It won't be on the college entrance exam"`—looking back, maybe our questions were too tricky, but at the time, we immediately elevated it to the level of `"China's education system is just a factory producing garbage."` We were really too clever.

We quickly became inflated, J even more so. Perhaps because of this, when I recall J now, all that remains is his habit of mentioning `"IQ"` in every other sentence and his utterly arrogant remark, `"A bunch of idiots."`

**This is thinking without learning.**

Indeed, I often pondered questions about the stars and the cosmos until midnight. My heart held the sun and moon, but I didn't understand the principle that `"A steed's single leap cannot cover ten paces; a nag traveling ten days succeeds through perseverance."` This was a pitfall I stepped into.

J's attitude clearly fell prey to the so-called `"Chinese cramming education,"` but I ultimately didn't degenerate alongside J.

In my second year, I switched classes and met another classmate—let's call him Y.

Y studied extremely diligently and was a rule-following student. I don't know how late Y studied every day or whether he did nothing but study after returning home—these things are beyond my knowledge. But at school, whenever I saw Y, except during times like morning exercises that couldn't be used for studying, Y was always diligently and earnestly working hard: taking meticulous notes in class—without even reading them, I could guess he wrote down every word the teacher wrote on the blackboard, perhaps including typos; diligently doing homework during breaks—when he encountered something he didn't understand (which happened about once per problem, except for those already done), he'd ask the top students in the class or the teacher, completely disregarding whether they were chatting with others or engaged in work that shouldn't be easily interrupted.

Y often had questions during class about something the teacher just explained: not understanding what it meant, when in fact, it had just been taught—at that moment, Y was copying the previous board notes. If you copy every single word without missing any, you can never keep up with the teacher.

I often lamented that if I had even half of Y's diligence, there'd be nothing I couldn't accomplish. Yet Y himself, in my view, achieved nothing. On the surface, he appeared hardworking and diligent, but in reality, he was dull and rigid—I call this an advanced form of laziness. Apart from the part of his brain used for rote memorization, the rest probably went unused.

**This is learning without thinking.**

`"Learning without thinking leads to confusion; thinking without learning leads to peril."` We've heard many such phrases repeatedly and understand their meanings, but we're unwilling to carefully ponder the principles they contain. Because we don't grasp these principles, most of us lean toward either J or Y, becoming tragic figures. Either we're unrecognized talents, buried geniuses, or we lack internal understanding and external application, achieving nothing in three years.

## Swift Horses Are Common

I hope to share my reflections in the previously agreed-upon capacity but without resorting to a preaching style with outlines and lists. As mentioned earlier, words are fingers, and the principles between the lines are the bright moon. Pointing at the moon with a finger often makes people mistake the finger for the moon. **It's better to guide you to find it yourselves.**

> One who harbors thunder in the chest yet maintains a calm countenance is worthy of being appointed a great general.
