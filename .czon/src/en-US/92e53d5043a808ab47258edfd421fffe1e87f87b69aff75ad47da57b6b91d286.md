"summary": "This article is a review of the film 'Escape from the 21st Century.' Starting from a personal viewing experience, the author deeply analyzes how the film contrasts the youthful longing for the future with the harsh reality of adulthood. The article points out that while the first half of the film is filled with laughter, its core is tragic. Through the experiences of three teenagers who suddenly find themselves in 38-year-old bodies, the film reveals the process of shattered dreams. The author is particularly moved by how the teenage Chengyong is forced to accept the dirty work of the adult world, considering this sudden deprivation too cruel. At the same time, reflecting on their own internship experience during their senior year of college, the author contemplates how people in the real world gradually adapt to role changes. The phrase 'existence precedes essence' is cited to explain that growth is a continuous process of experiencing reality and shaping one's essence. Finally, the author believes the film gently shatters a distorted future, and while people in reality cannot resist as fiercely as in the film, they can still retain some of the precious things from their youth."

# Review of 'Escape from the 21st Century'

> Spoiler warning (felt the need to mention this to avoid upsetting friends who haven't seen it)

I laughed a lot at the beginning, especially during the busy elder sister segment, but the further it went, the more I felt the tragic core of the film. Teenagers always have infinite longing for the future, fantasizing about countless unexpected joys of growing up: getting taller, living independently, supporting themselves, having a career, finding someone to love and seriously building a life together, and embarking on all the wonderful adventures they couldn't afford due to lack of money or time in their youth.

So, at first, after entering their 38-year-old bodies, the three teenagers were thrilled, thinking their dreams had come true. But within seconds, things started to feel off: it turns out the future might not be as wonderful as they imagined in their youth. Endless money comes with blood, sweat, and danger. The hard-earned achievements gained through a sense of justice are claimed by superiors. A complete physical transformation and living with the person they admired in their youth, only to be told they are actually unhappy.

What saddened me the most was that 18-year-old Chengyong actually started to play the role of his 38-year-old self, beginning to do what he considered dirty and burdensome "work." It felt too cruel for a teenager. For us in reality, if there is a gradual process of disillusionment with our future aspirations over time, it at least accumulates day by day, a result of being slowly pushed forward by the passage of time—not like suddenly snatching away a teenager's dreams and forcing them to accept a dark reality.

Fortunately, they could still return to 1999, fight in the classroom, gather at the boss's house to brainstorm solutions, and not have to face the helplessness of being 38 every moment.

This resonated deeply with me. During my final semester of senior year, interning in another city, I could still return to my familiar campus on statutory holidays or during important events. I consciously cherished my last moments of campus life, treasuring the final times with my roommates, friends, and the campus itself. In these moments, I strengthened my resolve, slowly and properly saying goodbye. Only then could I gradually adapt to this role change, accepting that I lived in an elaborate cage I had willingly jumped into, accepting that I no longer had the time or mindset to spend an entire week immersed in, say, The Witcher 3—living independently in another city.

I now think the phrase "existence precedes essence" means this: by opening one's heart to reality, experiencing various things wholeheartedly, and allowing oneself to be shaped by them, one encounters aspects that are partly or entirely unsatisfactory (maybe exceeding expectations, maybe falling short—I think there are both good and bad sides). That is the real world's impact on the human spirit, challenging one's symbolic system, generating desires, and finally settling within, becoming one's essence. The journey from 18 to 38 is perhaps the process of spending time existing, forming an essence, while constantly pruning the dreams of youth, yet growing, living, and becoming enriched.

But maybe because I'm exactly halfway between 18 and 38, I feel both clear and confused. The film gently shatters a distorted future with force and exercise. We who live in reality cannot force ourselves to drink a bottle of toxins and commit to the attainable cause of physical exercise, but we also haven't completely lost everything we cherished in our youth. So much so that, along with the film, we can open our shells and immerse ourselves in everything Liu Lianzhi loves and represents, finding warmth and solace there.
