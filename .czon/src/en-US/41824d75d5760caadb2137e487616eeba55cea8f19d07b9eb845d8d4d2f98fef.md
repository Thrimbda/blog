After thinking and considering for nearly a month, I’ve decided to use a new ID: **Thrimbda**.

What does it mean?

Alive and thrive.

The tail is taken from the English pronunciation of the Greek letter lambda, which represents great wisdom appearing as foolishness.

So,

**Thrimbda**!

I wasn’t satisfied with ending the article so short, so let me ramble a bit more.

## On Dao and Shu

To summarize, the knowledge in this world can be divided into two levels: **Dao** and **Shu**.

Dao is the overview;

It is the framework;

It is having a well-thought-out plan.

Shu, on the other hand, is the details;

It is the implementation;

It is exotic tricks.

As for me,

I can’t see my own Dao clearly,

Yet I’ve put a lot of effort into Shu.

How much of it has been in vain!
