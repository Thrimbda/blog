"title": "May 2024: Late-Night Reflections in Xuzhou"
"summary": "This article records the author's late-night reflections in Xuzhou in May 2024, focusing on a comparison between Web3 and traditional finance, reflections on various entrepreneurial attempts by the individual and their team in the Web3 space (such as copy trading, SaaS products, arbitrage, shitcoin sniping, funds, etc.), and the definition and search for a 'mission.' The author believes that Web3, compared to traditional finance, offers more transparent mechanisms and emerging organizational forms; although it is in its infancy, its prospects are bright. Through their attempts, the team recognized the importance of technical advantages and reflected on the criticality of energy allocation and direction selection. Finally, the author uses the example of Che Guevara to explain the meaning of a sense of mission: finding something one is destined to do, that is meaningful, and can guide one's life."

First Paragraph:
From our perspective, we don't have a strong advantage in dealing with licenses or channel-based business, but we do possess a technical advantage—that's the first point. Comparing Web3 to traditional finance, it is less mature but embodies some more advanced concepts and mechanisms than traditional finance. While it may not achieve full decentralization, it can likely make financial processes more transparent. Then there's timing: we are currently in a trough of the economic cycle. When the next wave of economic prosperity arrives, new technologies and concepts with structural advantages will replace or partially replace the old ones. The current prevalence of shitcoins indicates that it is entirely in its infancy. Overall, compared to traditional finance, it holds bright prospects and abundant opportunities, and our technical advantage can also be leveraged. Additionally, it provides an emerging form of labor organization (compared to companies) or at least offers new tools for traditional organizational forms like companies, making the digital nomad lifestyle possible, which aligns more closely with our ideal way of life.

Second Paragraph:
Over the past two years, I've developed some subjective feelings about the various money-making paths we've tried. I think I can just chat casually about them, typing on my phone as thoughts come to me. Some of these felt comfortable, some didn't; some money felt like it was rightfully ours to earn, some didn't.

1.  **Copy Trading Business:** Modeling people has always made me uncomfortable. It's not because we haven't succeeded at it now; I felt this way even when we were making money initially. Engaging in speculative strategies, perhaps the markets we operate in are too mature, giving a feeling of fishing in a vast ocean where a slight misstep can capsize the boat, leading to being swallowed as fish food. Or it's like gold panning: digging for a long time only yields dirt; occasionally hitting a poor vein might even cause a mining disaster. There might be times when the next swing of the pickaxe could strike a rich vein, but the feeling during the digging process is unbearably lonely.
2.  **Raising Funds to Build and Sell a SaaS Product:** It's truly difficult. We've hit walls for over half a year, but I still believe that Yuan, envisioned as everyone's investment operating system, is a great cause worth pursuing. This might require strategic thinking—starting from which part and gradually expanding to others. Although we hit a wall starting from a toB quantitative platform, I think it's worth trying some toC attempts combined with Web3's strong speculative atmosphere. This is something I feel can be pursued as a mission. I have a definition for 'mission,' which I can discuss later—it's a very high-level concept.
3.  **Arbitrage:** We've reached a consensus that this is the money we should have been making all along. My expectation for this is to establish a stable cash flow to support our other endeavors.
4.  **Attempts like Shitcoin Sniping or Participating in 'Primary Markets' Driven by KOL Calls:** Firstly, I feel this tests human nature too much. Every time you follow a big influencer's call and engage in PvP, I've tried it a few times—sometimes profiting, sometimes losing, with an overall slight loss. I have no doubt there are tricks and even methodologies that can be summarized here. But I think if it cannot be automated, investing energy into this is very inefficient and not worthwhile. It's a money-making method that doesn't make me feel comfortable.
5.  **Finally, Running a Fund:** Regarding funds, I have a feeling that it shouldn't be rushed. There needs to be a powerful profit engine behind it to support its operation. If this engine works well, everyone is happy; if not, everyone loses. Looking at our history, one could say we introduced the fund mechanism too early, which consumed some of our reputation among friends (because we gave investors expectations of quick, substantial profits but didn't deliver). This itself consumed a lot of our energy, making us clumsier than we could have been. In retrospect, perhaps we shouldn't have been so hasty.

Actually, when it comes down to it, it's really a question of energy allocation—where we allocate our energy on specific issues, choosing a direction. This is the most important meta-problem.

Third Paragraph:
Regarding mission, I think I can give an example to illustrate my feeling about it.
In his fourth year of university, Che Guevara didn't want to continue studying. He and an older friend hit the road, planning to ride north from Argentina on a single beat-up motorcycle, which broke down along the way. They said they wanted to see North America. Traveling along the route, they passed through Chile and witnessed the harsh living conditions of copper mine workers there. They met a communist couple. At that time, the Communist Party was declared illegal in Chile. That couple was displaced and destitute, shivering at night without even a blanket.

> Although the figures of this couple grew increasingly faint, almost disappearing from sight, the exceptionally resolute face of the husband remained indelibly etched in our minds. I remember him inviting us straightforwardly: "Come, comrades! Let's eat together! I'm also a wanderer with no fixed abode." His few words subtly conveyed a disdain for our aimless, dependent wandering.<br>Guevara wrote this in his diary.

Guevara was deeply shaken by this man. They themselves were aimless, but this couple, despite having no legal status and facing immense hardship, remained so resolute.

They were medical students. Later, they went to a leper colony to care for leprosy patients. When they left, they made a toast. The 24-year-old Guevara realized that people are essentially no different, especially on the South American continent. Although divided into many countries, they share cultural roots and speak the same language.

This ultimately led him to choose his mission—a communist mission. He eventually went to Cuba and, with Castro, realized the Cuban Revolution.

So, roughly speaking, this sense of mission is: there is something this person is destined to do. Regardless of whether it seems useful or what purpose it serves, for this person, it is the most meaningful thing. They feel this thing must be accomplished, and they believe it will be accomplished at some point within the next hundred or thousand years. They don't care if they themselves ultimately complete it; they must contribute their part. Starting from such a future, it guides every fleeting moment of their present life. In the end, they dedicate their precious time to this mission.

It's also possible that a person never finds a mission. Such a life isn't necessarily bad, but I believe a life that has found a mission is inevitably a good life.
