"title": "The Play 'Copenhagen': A Quantum Observation Experiment in the Depths of Human Nature"
"summary": "This article uses the play 'Copenhagen' as a starting point to delve into the historical mystery of the 1941 meeting between Heisenberg and Bohr, emphasizing that the complexity of human motivation holds greater research value than the historical truth itself. The article analyzes how the play, through the soulful dialogue of its three protagonists on the stage of war, knowledge, and interpersonal relationships, conducts a quantum experiment on ethics, morality, and the uncertainty of human nature. Combining personal viewing experience, the author reflects on how literary works can reach the soul with poetic, ambiguous imagery, inspire a pursuit of life's intensity, and encourage readers to add depth and wisdom to their lives through profound contemplation."

## The Mystery of Copenhagen

_History may become increasingly elusive as more historical materials emerge; we should focus on the invariants within human nature beneath the surface._

In 1941, German scientist Werner Heisenberg traveled to Copenhagen, Denmark—then occupied by Germany—to visit his former teacher, Niels Bohr. However, this reunion after four years ended quite unpleasantly and abruptly, completely severing their nearly two-decade-long deep friendship and, perhaps, forever altering the fate of the world.

This is the famous "Mystery of the Copenhagen Meeting."

For decades, people have debated the truth of this event. After the declassification of relevant archives post-Cold War and the release of more firsthand accounts from Heisenberg, Bohr, and scientists from various countries associated with them, it has become possible to roughly determine what happened during this meeting and what Heisenberg said to Bohr that caused Bohr's furious reaction, leading to their final split.

> "The conversation took place during an evening walk. I knew Bohr was under surveillance by the German authorities, so I tried to conduct the conversation in a way that would not endanger myself. The conversation likely began with my question: '**Is it right for physicists to devote themselves to uranium fission research during wartime?**' because progress in this field could lead to serious consequences for the war.
> Bohr immediately understood the meaning of the question and looked somewhat frightened. I remember him asking in return: 'Do you really think uranium fission can be used to make weapons?' I probably replied: 'In principle, it is possible, but it requires immense technical effort. We can only hope it won't be achieved during this war.'
> Bohr was shocked by my answer, evidently thinking I was conveying a message that Germany had made significant progress in developing atomic weapons. Although I later tried to correct this misunderstanding, I likely did not fully regain Bohr's trust, especially since I spoke only with extreme caution (which was absolutely my mistake) because I feared certain words might later be used against me. I was very dissatisfied with the outcome of this conversation."

> "I am particularly thinking of our conversation at the institute. During that conversation, the topic of 'war' came up, and I remember every word we said clearly.
> You began by saying you were convinced that if the war lasted long enough, it would be decided by atomic weapons, which made a deep impression on me. At the time, I knew nothing about the preparations underway in America. Just as I was somewhat skeptical, you added that I should understand you had been almost entirely preoccupied with this problem in recent years and had no doubt it could be solved.
> Therefore, I cannot understand at all your later suggestion that you had hinted to me that German physicists would do everything to prevent the application of atomic technology. During this brief exchange, I was very cautious and thought a great deal."

Historians of natural science generally agree that the outcome of the conversation likely had a profound impact on the direction of atomic bomb development and deployment by the two major warring factions during World War II, the nuclear threats facing the world today, and the future development of science and human survival.

However, the declassification of historical materials has not resolved the core mystery: **Why** did Heisenberg go to Copenhagen? What was his **motive**?

In my view, compared to the uncertain historical truth, the uncertainty of human behavior and motivation caused by the superposition of multiple identities holds greater research value. After all, history is a mirror. What we, as observers and the figures in the mirror, can see and feel from it, what kind of perception of the real world it forms, and how we use this perception to interact with the real world in turn—this is the most exquisite and fascinating value of this mirror for us.

## 'Copenhagen' as a Play

_A profound discussion of the antinomies arising from the complexity of human nature and the limitations of the human mind._

To explore the chaotic uncertainty in the depths of human nature—the intricate and complex **motivations** of humans—in the play 'Copenhagen,' the three protagonists: Heisenberg, Bohr, and Bohr's wife Margrethe appear on stage as souls in a void. Driven by their obsession with the truth of this mystery, they reenact that fateful meeting in the afterlife, unraveling the threads amidst the complex and contradictory superposition of identities and the uncertainty of human nature.

![theme](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/06/18/theme.jpg)

Why are "motivations" complex?

Because the real world is complex, containing an overwhelming amount of information, with participants interacting in collective unconsciousness; history is complex, evolving amidst countless contradictions, mingled with chance and necessity. We cannot, in a mechanistic materialist way, separate history, the people who constitute it, the environment that shaped them, their decisions and thoughts, and their relationships with each other, hoping to divide and conquer to obtain any meaningful answers.

Structure itself contains vast amounts of information, so much so that when the parts of a whole organically combine, countless unexpected new phenomena emerge.

Fortunately, humans are naturally fascinated by complex information that exceeds our processing capacity. Using complex reality as raw material, 'Copenhagen' builds its unique stage; by isolating and discussing various issues related to human nature in reality, 'Copenhagen' conducts an exquisite quantum experiment on human nature.

It highly condenses the most heart-wrenching and conflict-ridden parts of real history as its solid stage foundation:

First, war, the most devastating war in human history, divides the three protagonists into opposing camps; then knowledge is involved—the grand edifice of theory had just been built, and the discovery of nuclear fission made the development of nuclear weapons possible, raising suffocating moral challenges; finally, human connections bind it all together—father and son, teacher and disciple—placing the relationship between Heisenberg and Bohr, who were at the eye of the storm, at the center, constructing its most simple yet magnificent stage.

Upon this grand and solid stage foundation, the three vivid protagonists take the stage. With extreme care, their lives, values, achievements, and emotions are restored in the work. The experimental conditions are ready, so the most crucial energy element is added—Heisenberg's mysterious motive for going to Copenhagen initiates this astonishing experiment. Maintaining a scientific attitude during the experiment, allowing contradictions to develop freely, letting the participants collide violently to produce dazzling sparks. In this process, using lines that are casual, everyday, intense, or gentle, it discusses topics such as ethics, morality, human nature, and fate with profound depth, ultimately presenting the audience with an unparalleled masterpiece brimming with almost overflowing information.

## The Quantum Laws in the Depths of Human Nature

_As the old saying goes, "There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's eyes."_

The role of good literary works is not to state a fact or provide specific solutions to certain problems. In my view, their value and significance lie precisely in reaching the human soul with poetic, ambiguous imagery, allowing people to gain some kind of revelation. And this revelation is also like a mirror; everyone can observe different things—discussions on ethics and morality; critiques of reality; inquiries into human nature; emotional resonance, knowing smiles, trembling tears, fear, anxiety, anger, warmth, fascination... It seems like an infinite source of energy, from which our life processes gain many colors and a bit more substance.

In the summer of 2018, the company where I interned was located in Wudaokou. I had just graduated from university, like a blank sheet of paper; dragged by a fellow intern senior to Peking University to watch this graduate performance of 'Copenhagen.' Since then, this play, resonating with real-life experiences, has echoed in my mind like a chain reaction, growing increasingly intense.

_This photo even has me in it_

For me, that poetic revelation began with the following lines:

When reviewing the establishment of the "Copenhagen Interpretation," Bohr says to Heisenberg:

---

> **Bohr** It works, yes. But it’s more important than that. Because you see what we did in those three years, Heisenberg? Not to exaggerate, but we turned the world inside out! Yes, listen, now it comes, now it comes .… We put man back at the centre of the universe. Throughout history we keep finding ourselves displaced. We keep exiling ourselves to the periphery of things. First we turn ourselves into a mere adjunct of God’s unknowable purposes, tiny figures kneeling in the great cathedral of creation. And no sooner have we recovered ourselves in the Renaissance, no sooner has man become, as Protagoras proclaimed him, the measure of all things, than we’re pushed aside again by the products of our own reasoning! We’re dwarfed again as physicists build the great new cathedrals for us to wonder at—the laws of classical mechanics that predate us from the beginning of eternity, that will survive us to eternity’s end, that exist whether we exist or not. Until we come to the beginning of the twentieth century, and we’re suddenly forced to rise from our knees again.
>
> **Heisenberg** It starts with Einstein.
>
> **Bohr** It starts with Einstein. He shows that measurement—measurement, on which the whole possibility of science depends—measurement is not an impersonal event that occurs with impartial universality. It’s a human act, carried out from a specific point of view in time and space, from the one particular viewpoint of a possible observer. Then, here in Copenhagen in those three years in the mid-twenties we discover that there is no precisely determinable objective universe. That the universe exists only as a series of approximations. Only within the limits determined by our relationship with it. Only through the understanding lodged inside the human head.

Are we the masters of all things?

> If people measured themselves by strictly discernible quantities... we would need a novel quantum ethics.

The chaos and complexity inherent in us, the masters, lead to the fact that people do not always understand each other. Even we ourselves are sometimes unknowable. So we are always searching, trying to solve the mysteries left in the past.

> We are still searching when our lives end.

The world will not end with humanity.

> Everything was spared, very likely, precisely because of that brief moment in Copenhagen, that event which can never be located or defined, that ultimate kernel of uncertainty at the heart of things.

## Afterword

Like many poems I love, I devoured this play whole. Then, at certain moments in life, it always sparks into my mind bit by bit. I begin to savor, chew, and ponder it, absorbing some wisdom, or at least gaining a bit of pleasure.

But is that enough?

For years, I've had the impulse to write this article. But one day in 2019, after writing the title in front of my computer and staring blankly for hours, I almost trembled and gave up. What kind of depth, wisdom, and breadth must a person have to write a review of this play that wouldn't be self-humiliating? I was too young; I had none of these things. I wasn't worthy of writing it.

But is retreating with such an attitude acceptable? Then, expecting to continue recklessly and indiscriminately devouring all sorts of good things without seeking deep understanding, wasting precious gifts, all the way until 90 years old, hoping for sudden enlightenment to turn decay into magic?

No, that is a waste of life. It makes the taste of everything too bland. A life too bland is not worth living.

> Verse, Fame, and Beauty are intense indeed.
> But Death's intenser -- Death is Life's high meed.

So, before death, live as intensely as possible. But what is 'intense'?

It is the rich aroma of life;
It is the radiance of human nature;
Perhaps it is the Olympic spirit, challenging oneself and pushing limits;
It is making oneself a bridge, a path toward the Übermensch;
It is the tree on the mountain, rooted in the darkest depths, growing toward the highest sky, and then waiting for the thunder.

Thus, we welcome the highest reward of our lives, and death thereby becomes intense.

Life is servitude; death is rest. Only an intense life deserves an even more intense death.

Today, compared to the depth, wisdom, and breadth needed to write that **perfect** review, I am still penniless, young, and shallow. But perhaps what matters is not "perfection," but the determination to squeeze the marrow from the bones. Perhaps it is precisely each act of squeezing the marrow that can increase a person's depth, wisdom, and breadth. Perhaps only in this way can life become more intense.
