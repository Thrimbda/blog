"summary": "This is a short blog post where the author, while reviewing their own code, discovered a logical error: it is known that A and B are mutually exclusive, but the code uses nested if statements (if(A) { ... if(B) { ... } ... }), which makes the code logic unreasonable. The author expresses confusion and self-mockery, implying that their brain might have malfunctioned. The core of the article emphasizes the importance of code review and how programmers should avoid obvious logical contradictions when writing code to improve code quality and maintainability."

Today, while reviewing my own code, I actually saw something like this:

**Given that A and B are mutually exclusive**

```java
if(A) {
  something1;
  if(B) {
    something2;
  }
  something3;
}
```

I really think there must be something wrong with my brain.
