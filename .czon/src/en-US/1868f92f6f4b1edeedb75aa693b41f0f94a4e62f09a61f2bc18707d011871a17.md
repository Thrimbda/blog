## Hello

I've finally mustered some interest to renovate my long-neglected blog.

In 2024, my life is at a stage where the desire for expression can be quickly and easily satisfied offline. Although there are often many things I want to write about, spending time writing articles feels somewhat extravagant to me. So, I've been quite lazy about maintaining my blog. Coincidentally, Hexo's CI broke down, providing a perfect opportunity to switch to something new.

Hence, this.

After briefly evaluating NextJS, Gatsby, and Hexo, and to avoid wasting this fleeting urge to tinker with my blog, I ultimately chose the single-binary static site generator Zola. I didn't conduct extensive research, but it genuinely meets my current needs:

1. Write in Markdown.
2. As long as this binary exists, I can still publish via CI ten years from now, without build failures due to outdated dependencies (looking at you, Hexo).
3. The theme is simple enough that I can easily maintain it myself.

Maybe in the future, when I have more time to experiment, I'll try creating a more flexible and flashy blog. But for now, this will do.

Looking back at an article I wrote years ago when I first set up my blog, I found it quite interesting, so I'll leave it here.

> After returning to school, I made some changes to my half-finished website and started thinking about the personal blog I've been eyeing for a long time. I used to be excited about JianShu because it supported Markdown, so I eagerly registered. After writing a couple of essays, I still felt it was too restrictive and not free enough—perhaps I was nitpicking. Seeing Ah Zheng's blog[^1] thriving, I immediately felt I, Tu Yang, still had a lot to learn.
