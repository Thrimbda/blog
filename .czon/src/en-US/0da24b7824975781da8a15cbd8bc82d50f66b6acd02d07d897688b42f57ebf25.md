# On New Life

- Death Stranding, the connections between people
- The principal contradiction
- Love in the Time of Cholera
- Must remember: writing this essay now is also forcing myself to organize my thoughts to face the future
- Accompanying my journey to look at apartments, summarizing and looking ahead
- Loss of Control & Control
- Clumsiness -> means more practice is needed.

## Part One
On the subway last Sunday, on my way to look at apartments, I sat in a corner seat, hand covering my bowed head, feeling utterly miserable, like a stray dog.

This was the first time I truly felt the sensation of parting.

## Too Perfect
This feeling of imperfection is not unfamiliar. What is imperfect is my restless heart, which is why I have always been searching, exploring, and experiencing—it has been a major driving force in my life.

For nearly the past four years, there was no imperfection, only contentment, laziness, and indulgence.

Perfection is not about being flawless in every way. I want to reinterpret the meaning of this word: people experience joy and sorrow, parting and reunion; the moon waxes and wanes. The combination of all these phases is what makes it real. I don't believe everything **should** be perfect. If there were only perfection, it would become utterly meaningless.

Apart from work, my life had gradually stagnated over the past period. We spent less and less time nurturing it. Specifically, chopsticks would be left to mold in the sink with no one caring to clean them. Our lives seemed to be dampened and drained of vitality in some water-like medium.

To put it bluntly, certain aspects of life were gradually withering away. This is the only thing I am certain of right now. As for the rest, I have no idea. Being in the mountains, I only see jagged rocks, tangled roots, and unpredictable weather—the one thing I cannot see is the mountain itself.

I also don't know where this suffocating feeling comes from. Did we fail to manage things well? Was the passion meant to fade? Or were we just not prepared? I don't know. Actually, I know it's a bit of all these things.

## Part Two
Actually, the night before, I contacted a Ziroom agent and arranged to see some apartments near Songjiang University Town around 2:30 PM on Sunday. Songjiang is far from Yangpu—nearly a two-hour trip. The reason we didn't stick to the plan wasn't just because we woke up late; we also watched some TV together at noon and didn't leave until 1:30 PM. So, I informed the agent in advance that we'd reschedule, but I still set out to get a haircut.

Being overly depressed on the road isn't good for mental health. Being exposed to too much unfamiliar environment at once can easily trigger a stress response. Plus, since it was on the way, I spontaneously decided to visit my familiar barber for a haircut.

## Loss of Control
People are containers, but the heart desires things beyond their capacity. When it can't hold them, that's loss of control. What does losing control feel like?

Clumsiness. The thought of having to clumsily pick up the pieces of a solitary life for the next little while gives me a headache. I was once familiar with this kind of life and handled it with ease. However, after four years of neglect and lack of practice, I am no longer accustomed to it. The result is clumsiness—so clumsy that I don't even know where to start writing this article.

Fear. Fear that my occasionally anxious heart will feel lost, restless, even silently screaming in the dim room after a nap, then be filled with a sense of emptiness, rendering me unable to do anything until I start regretting having accomplished nothing all day.

The feeling of losing control is painful, but ultimately, it's not unfamiliar. It's like when you write an item in your work TODO list that you don't know how to implement—you get this feeling. Most of the time, as you gradually understand the matter better, solutions emerge. A sense of control gradually eats away at the feeling of being out of control, and your heart feels much more settled.

Mencius said: "If you seek, you will get it; if you give up, you will lose it. This seeking is beneficial for attainment because what is sought lies within me. There is a way to seek it, but whether you attain it depends on fate. This seeking is not beneficial for attainment because what is sought lies outside."

The more I ponder these words, the more meaningful they become: Some things can be obtained simply through effort—straightforward, with few variables affecting them, full of order. Other things have a method for seeking them, but no guarantee of attainment. Between seeking and attaining, there exist countless variables, even inexplicable ones—truly a realm of chaos.

Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat all things as straw dogs. The universe holds no malice toward humans. In such an objective world, people need to manage their relationship with their own hearts, expanding their capacity as humans amidst widespread loss of control. To avoid sinking into chaos in this process, one must actively seek some sense of control. To summarize abstractly: I need to deliberately plunge into the abyss of chaos while simultaneously creating countless small universes filled with order within that chaos.

Life is like this. Work has actually been like this for a long time.

Regretting the past is futile; knowing the future can be pursued. We will all embark on new life journeys, and time will allow the seeds we plant to grow.

## Part Three
It had been too long since my last visit. Barber Jiawen and his team moved to a new shop in Jiuting. Finally seeing a familiar face was truly a joy. My hair, which I had grown for over half a year, was also happy—it was finally going to stand up properly.

Jiawen poured me a glass of water, surprised that I had become so wild-looking. Then he gave me a haircut like Oguri Shun's style. However, having gained a few pounds, I ended up looking more like Gao Xiaosong. I must lose weight.

## Part Three Point Five
The feeling of losing control also comes from work.

## Part Four
I still insisted on meeting a few Lianjia agents to look at apartments. Songjiang was much better than I imagined—the infrastructure was good, it didn't seem too noisy, and the rent was considerably cheaper than in the city center.

After viewing the apartments, I had a meal at a Shaanxi noodle restaurant with CZ. What was depressing about this day was the feeling of losing control, but partially familiar things and expectations for the future caught me. Perhaps it's like the saying: "Leaping over the abyss, no blame."

## Future Plans

Not finished, to be continued.
