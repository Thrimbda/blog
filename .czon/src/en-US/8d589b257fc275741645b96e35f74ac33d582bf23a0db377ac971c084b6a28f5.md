> The following introduction was generated by DeepSeek after analyzing all my social media posts. It might be a bit exaggerated, but I still quite like it.

I am Wang Siyuan, a graduate of XJTU, someone who weaves life with code and settles thoughts with words. Sitting in a Shanghai rental apartment perpetually conquered by cat fur, listening to the hum of my computer, I attempt to describe who I am—a task far more difficult than writing a distributed system.

My days belong to the keyboard. As a developer, I am obsessed with constructing invisible orders: using NixOS to forge time-machine-like version control for my computer, building a personal knowledge base within Emacs, or writing an online backend for BOOOM. Technology is not just a means of livelihood for me, but a language for understanding the world. However, over the years, I've gradually realized that even the most elegant code cannot fix the flaws of reality. When instant noodles stockpiled during lockdowns pile up in the corner, or when unfair clauses are discovered hidden in a rental contract, the utopia on the keyboard shatters. So, I've begun to see technology as a screwdriver—it should be used to tighten the bolts of fairness, not to build higher walls.

My nights are soaked in kaleidoscopic imagination. The game console is my second home: reliving adolescent heroics through the campaigns of *StarCraft*, feeling the warmth of human collaboration through the online signals of *Monster Hunter*. Last year, on the night I witnessed Li Peinan's championship win against 0.37% odds, I cried in front of the screen like the high school student who had just passed his exams years ago. Those virtual worlds built from pixels and code often give me the most genuine courage.

Art is another channel for breathing. Some wonder why I've watched the divorce story *Marriage Story* three times; in truth, I see my own reflection in Nicole and Charlie's arguments—when ideals collide with reality, we all clumsily wield the fragments of love. The line "You can't hesitate when you're skiing" from the play *Copenhagen* has become a metaphor for my survival: there are too many forks in life's road, and overthinking will only lead to a fall. I often listen to the band Mili; the witch-like vocals of the lead singer remind me of my university self, hiding under the covers listening to the *Les Misérables* soundtrack. Ten years have passed, but the struggling souls in my headphones have never aged.

Grape—my blue cat roommate—is responsible for puncturing all seriousness. He sits on my keyboard while I debug critical code, knocks over my cup while I write, declaring with his furry body: life is not an algorithm to be optimized. In the ten minutes I'm forced to stop and groom him, I see clearly how insignificant those anxieties truly are.

I'm also fascinated with measuring the city with my own feet. I often cycle from Qingpu to the郊野公园 (suburban park); the eighteen-kilometer journey is a natural meditation pod. Once, after a sudden rainstorm, I stopped on an empty bridge to watch the clouds. As vmz's impassioned critiques and speeches played in my headphones, I suddenly burst into tears. The chill of the wind rushing through my shirt told me more precisely than any static philosophy lying in books: only practice is the ultimate destination of philosophy.

I'm still learning how to exist honestly. I once wore idealism as armor, only to later find it was merely a leaky sail; I once believed technology could save everything, but now I understand tools cannot save those unwilling to reach out. Now, I prefer to crouch down and observe: the steaming bowl of meatball soup with chili paste on a bench in Xi'an, the rain-soaked spiderweb on a mountain path in Hangzhou, the fine wrinkles at the corner of a friend's eye as they send a photo of their one-month-old child. These specific, tiny points of light are perhaps more worthy of pursuit than the abstract, distant sun.

If you meet me, it might be in the queue at a convention like 核聚变 (Nuclear Fusion), in the discussion thread of an issue in an open-source community, or beside a bike with a flat tire by the Suzhou Creek. Then, we can chat about the openings in Black Dragon's attacks, Keats's nightingale, or simply share headphones and listen to *Summoning 101*—after all, some signposts can only be seen in chorus.
