"title": "Sleeping to Dream"
"summary": "This article, from Bryan's perspective, depicts how sorrow, as a delayed emotion, re-invades his life. Sorrow is described as a warm fluid sloshing in the chest, corroding the heart, while memories act like spooky action at a distance, manipulating this 'abyssal soup.' When Bryan opens the cellar door filled with discarded memories, he is struck by 'ghosts' mingled with pleasure and resentment, causing him to lose his sense of time, unable to distinguish past from present. The text references Keats' 'Ode on Melancholy,' further deepening the theme of sorrow intertwined with beauty and joy. Ultimately, Bryan realizes his limitations as a one-dimensional temporal being, yet he still becomes an involuntary sacrifice to the spiral of tragedy, revealing the bleakness of humanity caught between divinity and beastliness."

Bryan never imagined that sorrow could also be delayed—the ghosts of the past have returned, and this time, he no longer has the strength to resist.

If asked to describe the shape of **sorrow** now, he would say it’s like a fluid, held in the chest, sloshing as he walks, spilling out a little to corrode his heart. When lying down, it flows steadily, trembling only with each heartbeat.

As for its temperature, it’s certainly not cold—it’s warm, slightly hotter than the chest, slowly releasing heat to simmer the heart. It feels like... a slow simmer, stewing with pain, yet never fully cooked, with active nerves constantly reminding him of the taste of **pain**.

There is only one kind of spooky action at a distance in this world—the **memories** manipulating this pot of abyssal soup from the back of his head. After fermenting for over a year alongside a fate as fragile as raindrops on duckweed, the moment he opened the cellar door filled with discarded memories, the brewed ghosts surged up, carrying the warm, sweet scent of pleasure and resentment, hitting him like a heavy hammer. The manifestation, in my view, was truly shameful—or, to put it plainly, shameful to the point of humiliation. I had never seen him like this before. Sincere, confident, and once youthful and candid, he is now lost in time, unable to distinguish what happened now, what happened two years ago, or what he thought happened yesterday but actually occurred a year ago. These **memories**, which he believed he had long lost over the past year, have now dispersed in such a clear and visible form among all other orderly memories, infecting them like cancer. Even earlier, cleaner memories have now taken on sharp edges, wandering in his mind.

Unfortunately, poor Bryan is merely a pitiful one-dimensional temporal being, unaware that his mind, at certain moments, only serves as a medium for transmitting distant information to his countless iterations later, while engaging in foolish acts of confidence tinged with faint sorrow. At this moment, he finally realizes the **bleakness** of humanity, caught between gods and beasts, yet still uncontrollably becoming a sacrifice to this spiral tragedy.

Ode on Melancholy

BY JOHN KEATS


No, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist
       Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;
Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd
       By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine;
               Make not your rosary of yew-berries,
       Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be
               Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl
A partner in your sorrow's mysteries;
       For shade to shade will come too drowsily,
               And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.

But when the melancholy fit shall fall
       Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,
That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,
       And hides the green hill in an April shroud;
Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,
       Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,
               Or on the wealth of globed peonies;
Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,
       Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,
               And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.

She dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die;
       And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips
Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,
       Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:
Ay, in the very temple of Delight
       Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine,
               Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue
       Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;
His soul shalt taste the sadness of her might,
               And be among her cloudy trophies hung.
```

Now he is filled with desolation, poor Bryan.
