There are some things I want to write down.

A bean-sized drop of sweat falls to the ground. I notice another drop landing on the conveyor belt of the security scanner.

Because I have to get from BUPT to Beijing West Station to check in and board the train within half an hour: during the frantic dash, I only stop to catch my breath while waiting in line, noticing the ground again.

A year has passed.

Some questions, once they materialize from thoughts into language in the mind, already have answers. This article was started a month ago because of scattered thoughts. While eating, waiting for the bus, walking, or sleeping, as soon as my mind wanders slightly, they seize the chance to sneak into my head from every corner of the world; but when I really want to grasp them, they betray me, slipping away, as if deliberately keeping their distance from me.

But regardless, after a whole year, there are always some things I want to write.

## The Old Steed in the Stable

Both ends of this year—the starting point and the endpoint—are the **MSC Summer Camp**, so let's start from here.

Compared to last year, this time I clearly felt a sense of loss. The reasons, aside from carrying mental baggage, include reserving the place for such precious memories for last year, holding back a bit. Thinking this way, even I find it somewhat sentimental—but it's true. So I didn't participate much in discussions, except once when the idea proposed by Little Fatty in our group was so worth attacking that I immediately spoke up to challenge it.

On **Day 2**, everyone went to Nanluoguxiang to explore. The familiar subway station railings no longer had Brother Yong leaning against them, and this bustling alley lost its novelty for me. While changing the string of a bracelet in one of the small shops, I blood-sacrificed a bead—it flew onto the street when the shop owner cut the old string and was never found again. Beyond anger, I faintly felt this was actually fate.

So I skipped **Day 3**'s City Tour to find Xiao Dai. I estimated that a year's time couldn't change a person's appearance much, so I recognized her at first glance as she rushed out energetically from the direction of the Intelligent Building to open the door. Truly delightful! Visiting a friend without any baggage. I secretly resolved to remember the library of the Intelligent Building and those punk-style high-rises in Zhongguancun in my heart. Two days later, I added another obsession to these: I must eat the yellow peach beef at BUPT again in this lifetime.

## The Past Days Are Full of Bitterness

The brief trip to the capital has already ended.

Returning to my **balanced** but **unstable** life, balanced because I am content within it and do not seek change. Unstable because there is underlying pressure that makes one try to make some changes or become颓废. Long ago in Chinese class when I learned the word "颓废," I didn't know it would become my great enemy.

To put it plainly, I am too good to myself, unwilling to make myself act decisively. I need some stimulation to move forward, to experience immense怅然 the moment a dream is shattered, and thus seek change.

> Forlorn! the very word is like a bell
>    To toll me back from thee to my sole self!

Like the怅然 Keats felt after watching the nightingale fly away until its song disappeared. Except my pressure doesn't come from a terminal illness; compared to this ill-fated poet, I am more youthful and hopeful, but why am I becoming more and more颓废?

**Perhaps this is me going through the most difficult part of university.**

But who knows?

## How to Relieve Worries

How to relieve worries? Cao Cao's answer I find quite ordinary. Drinking is always that easy choice; everyone knows how to drown sorrows in alcohol, but waking up the next day only brings a headache that makes one reflect on life, with little other benefit. The answer to this question may be different for everyone; for me, it seems the root of all problems lies in not being able to calm my mind; neither anxiety nor carefreeness are emotions a normal person should have. So we must all survive between these two extremes.

Thinking of a movie I recently saw: *Bright Star* directly uses a sonnet Keats gave to Fanny as its title, and the entire film tells the love story between Keats and Fanny in the three years before he died abroad. The whole movie is quiet and full of beauty, worth watching with a calm mind. What I want to talk about is Keats himself. After the movie's ending, text reads: *Keats died at twenty five, believing himself a failure. Today he is recognized as one of the greatest Romantic Poets.* What I want to say is, think about Keats' experiences—what made him, what caused his early death? Setting aside the possibility that he was a genius, which may not be a reason. **Because we all believe that circumstances create heroes, and heroes shape circumstances.** People's worlds influence each other. Under what circumstances can a person write such poetry? I think perhaps only in England at that time, in such窘迫困境, could Keats become Keats. People then revered art—poetry certainly included—and life was extremely艰苦. Poets could only break free from现实枷锁 through thought, as said in *Ode to a Nightingale*:

> Away! away! for I will fly to thee,
>
> Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,
>
> But on the viewless wings of Poesy,

So how to relieve worries? What is worth pursuing?

The answer to this question isn't that simple, but from what we see and learn, we can still find some clues.

## Sing to Express Aspirations

At the beginning of this article, I mentioned my trip to Beijing, so let's continue from here.

On the evening of **Day 5**, Cutuy and I talked almost all night in the hotel, very enlightening. I mentioned before that this world is layered; what do we rely on to climb upward? What helps us climb faster? I've heard a saying and quite agree with it: *We can change, because we are educated.* Education brings a person knowledge and, through this knowledge, grants a broader **perspective**. Through each person's perspective, we summarize what we see into methodology to establish ourselves in this world. But different angles of observation lead to different conclusions. Thinking this way is quite interesting.

Later, I shamelessly went to BUPT to蹭 a meal from Xiao Dai, then desperately ran (rode) to West Station to catch the train. Hence the opening scene of sweat dripping to the ground, so I started writing on the train and have been writing for ten days until today. How fortunate, sing to express aspirations.
