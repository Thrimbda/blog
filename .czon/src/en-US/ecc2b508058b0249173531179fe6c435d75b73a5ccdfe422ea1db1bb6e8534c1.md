On the day I decided to take a Gap, I bought my first pack of cigarettes and six bottles of beer, halted everything I was working on, boarded the bus home, and prepared to spend an evening with myself.

For me that day, the uncertainty of the future felt distant.

## The Hundred-Mile Traveler

To put it bluntly, this was the culmination of a long period of brewing thoughts, and because I suddenly came to a realization, it seemed unacceptable. Thinking of this, I felt the brevity of my life and envied the endless flow of the Yangtze River. In the end, I calmly swallowed it all down along with the beef and beer, leaving only the lowest line of the six lines of the hexagram Qian that I had seen many years ago in my mind: **First Nine: Hidden Dragon, Do Not Act.**

Looking back on my four years of confusion, I couldn’t see my own path clearly. Starting over from scratch was almost routine, yet I still, in an almost cruel way, assigned reasons to the path I had vaguely chosen long ago. Miraculously, I never strayed off course.

If I were to summarize, first I must explain a principle.

### A Syllogism

People never feel anxious about what they lack and are unaware of. Fortunately, once knowledge is acquired, it can be said to be possessed. Therefore, to some extent, we are all satisfied with our current level of intelligence.

But overall, we still progress. The beautiful expectations for future life compel a person to exert every effort to overcome the challenges of reality, sometimes even willingly seeking out difficulties. Generally, we call this process exploration. Thus, our spiritual level gradually rises through hardship, and we never wish to return to the past.

So, whether or not I reach the destination, I am grateful for the ninety miles I have already traveled.

As for a final judgment, it is impossible. The coffin is not yet closed; I still have many more hundred-mile journeys to walk. So, let the detailed stories remain in my diary.

For the remaining ten miles of this journey, I hope to summarize it with the second line of the hexagram Qian: **Second Nine: Dragon Appearing in the Field. It is beneficial to see the great man.**

## The Hardest Half

In short, that night I talked all night with the Master who had always encouraged me, and in the end, I peacefully confirmed that I had chosen the path most suitable for myself. The next day, I spent a quiet and pleasant afternoon with my father, who had returned to Xi’an for a meeting. To my delight, I found myself increasingly enjoying spending time with my parents.

Moving forward, I hope to continue exploring and never lose my curiosity.
