"summary": "This article is the author's deep reflection on the stagnation experienced in mid-2025. Using a ship as a metaphor, the author compares reason to the rudder and sails, and desire to the wind or engine, describing the predicament of being trapped in the 'doldrums' due to the reset of the team's main narrative, which severed external feedback. The article analyzes the imbalance between two sources of motivation—duty-driven and interest-driven—and points out that over-reliance on external order (such as team recognition) can break the chain of meaning. Through metaphors from psychoanalysis and economic cycles, the author diagnoses the core problem as the bankruptcy of the 'desire economy.' Ultimately, the author proposes a reconstruction plan: abandon the pursuit of a perfect symbolic order, and instead, by taking risks and formulating actionable plans, iteratively correct course in reality, thereby taking charge of one's own chain of meaning."

> Perhaps this is my 2025 summary?

If a person is like a ship, then reason is its rudder and sails, determining direction and adjusting posture; while desire is more like the engine, or the wind: it doesn't guarantee which port you'll reach, but it determines whether you can even leave the harbor.

The wind cannot push a ship without sails, nor can a ship move forward by rudder alone.

Since the end of May 2025, I have been caught in a certain symptom, leaving my ship adrift and motionless on the vast ocean. No direction, no wind. It wasn't a slowdown for "taking a break," but a strange, complete stagnation—tasks were piling up, schedules were turning, yet I felt as if my propulsion had been removed; even "getting started" became laborious, leading to a complete standstill.

This is my description and reflection on that state at the time. I didn't reach any conclusions then, only trying to understand what was wrong with me, attempting to analyze my own inner world.

## Symptoms

From the end of May 2025, I was somewhat lost, sinking into a state of "unwillingness to do anything." The reason for this state was unclear to me at the time. Looking back later, I could only retroactively construct the cause through some clues. In other words, depending on different present circumstances, these explanations might also be vastly different.

Thinking became abundant, while action became scarce. I could deduce many possibilities, write many analyses, and compare many "optimal solutions"; but genuine decision-making and commitment, on the contrary, became less frequent. During that time, I had many metaphysical conversations with CZ, who expressed considerable confusion and dissatisfaction, as did I.

### Imbalance of Two Driving Forces

To explain all this, I need to divide the sources of motivation into two categories: one driven more by external order, and the other pulled more by internal interest. For convenience, I'll call them **duty-driven** and **interest-driven**.

> If borrowing a bit of psychoanalytic language, they roughly correspond to two common subjective stances: one more reliant on "being driven by external order," the other more reliant on "being pulled by internal interest." But here, I won't strictly correspond them, only using them to illustrate the difference.

For me, duty-driven means: meaning lies outside the subject. I do things to complete an existing order, making it more stable and complete. Interest-driven is the opposite: meaning is more endowed by the subject. I do things to create a new order, causing the world to change a bit due to my intervention.

These two driving forces, I believe, should occupy a person's time and energy in a balanced way. The scale tipping too far toward either end can cause trouble. Excessive duty-drivenness can make a person exhausted, ultimately looking back without knowing what they were busy with, and most severely, losing a sense of meaning. Excessive interest-drivenness can easily lead to working behind closed doors, isolating oneself from the external world without realizing it, ignoring many external signals while focusing only on one's inner world, and ultimately still having to deal with the relationship with the order of the external world.

The problem was: during that period, these two driving forces were imbalanced within me, and the imbalance was very subtle.

Over the past few years, I had long been accustomed to playing a role in the team that was more logistical, more infrastructural: building, completing, maintaining, and providing backup. Such work is very important, but it inherently has a structure: **it depends on a main narrative**. When the main narrative is clear, the meaning of logistics is lasting and stable—function advancement, team operation, risk reduction, progress control, one link after another, with a clear path of return.

But when the team's main tasks were reset to an "initial state"—old goals zeroed out, old priorities invalidated—my accustomed duty-driven circuit suddenly lost its anchor: there were still many things to do, but each seemed like a side quest; I could still do them, but doing or not doing them didn't seem to change the fact that the "main narrative was not yet established." Thus, external order no longer gave me feedback, the meaning of duty-driven motivation was dissolved, interest-driven motivation had not yet taken over, and so the entire ship entered the doldrums.

I thought at the time that it was because I "hadn't figured it out," but now I'm more willing to admit: it was a consequence of **having a single source of motivation and a feedback mechanism overly reliant on an external harbor**. My wind came from one place; when that place disappeared, the vast ocean immediately became a stagnant pond.

### Unfinished Thoughts

> This chapter contains my thoughts at the time. I originally expected a concrete action plan but got stuck on it.
#### Why Thinking is Needed

A temporary slowdown in pace isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as it can facilitate some results in thinking, helping to re-establish order.

This thinking must be systematic, so as to distinguish between fantasy and genuine thinking. I describe the thinking process as follows: a person, based on various favorable and unfavorable conditions in their current situation, arrives at a conclusion about how to act—an action plan. This action plan must withstand scrutiny from various angles to judge whether it is reasonable and tenable. If reasonable, then the next step should be logical action; otherwise, it will be replaced by a new conclusion that addresses the incompleteness or immaturity of the previous one. This process can be repeated until reaching an **absolute**, unchanging state.

This action plan is the inevitable result of the subject bearing the weight of life. Scarcity produces desire, and desire drives the subject to continuously attempt to symbolize the real world. However, a person cannot integrate themselves into a "perfect" symbolic order and become static matter, because the world cannot be static. A person can never definitively state what their symbolic essence specifically is. Since the death of God (or since people finally realized God never existed), humans can no longer grasp their own essence (or rather, the essence that once existed was an illusion). Only the subject exists, needing to notice every moment that the real world has changed, accept and understand it, and then re-register it into the symbolic system—just like an oil film on flowing water constantly changing its hue, trying to completely cover the water's surface. This action plan points to a future; as this future pulls the subject toward itself, the subject is continuously reborn, rather than decaying, rather than dying.

#### Abandoning Thought?

We need to consider a possibility: **Is it possible for a person to abandon thought?**

First, complete abandonment means giving up on formulating any action plan. But from the moment of birth, a person can no longer return to the mythical state of desirelessness before birth. Scarcities from physiology to psychology drive a person to do something to fill these lacks. Therefore, completely abandoning thought is impossible.

#### Thinking Forever?

Is there a possibility that this thinking forever oscillates in a state of swaying?

Of course, there is such a possibility. Behind this recursive behavior of constantly overturning previous thoughts is the subject's refusal to finally specify an action plan, refusal to acknowledge the existence of a future. Then, time becomes meaningless to the subject. This cycle—it is essentially a cyclical escape, evading the responsibility of being an existent, enjoying pleasure within this cycle. Admittedly, this pleasure holds considerable attraction; otherwise, why would there be so many people addicted to scrolling through TikTok?
#### My Critique

Being lost is shameful because there are no people who live detached from worldly affairs. If a person is not being kept, then based on their own current situation, they are first forced to act; otherwise, they would starve.

## Looking Back

At that time, I left a critique and got stuck. The original next chapter was "Action Plan," which should have described a goal I could be loyal to after the deep thinking mentioned above, and from this goal, deduced how to act at every moment. But I ultimately didn't write it out; at least, I didn't arrive at such an action plan at that time. So, after leaving that critique, this article was shelved. I believe the root cause was not that I lost reason, nor that there was something wrong with the performance of my ship itself. It was that I lost the wind, lost motivation.

I tried to anchor myself through absolute thinking, seeking a "perfect" action plan to end all uncertainty. But this precisely plunged me into the "pleasure of thinking"—constantly deducing and overturning, replacing real-world choices with the oscillation of speculation. I later realized that this itself was part of the symptom: when external meaning guarantees failed, I fantasized about replacing them by constructing a complete symbolic order through introspection. This was destined to be futile because **the endpoint of thinking is not a perfect answer, but the determination to take responsibility**.

I now believe that all philosophy must move toward practice. Zarathustra must descend the mountain; the person who leaves the cave must also return to the cave—not to repeat the narrative of enlightenment, but because it is only in the friction of the human world that thought is realized.
Therefore, what I need to end is not thinking itself, but that oscillation that takes pleasure in overturning and finds safety in hesitation: it made me seem to be approaching truth, while in reality, I was avoiding commitment.
I want to change to another posture in life: first, implement a phased direction into action, then use the results of the action to correct the direction; let reality be the judge, let contradictions drive progress, rather than letting me spin in place.

And now I am already moving forward at full capacity and need to further optimize efficiency at the rational level. Therefore, I am picking up this previous article to complete it.

## Diagnosis

This is how I think about the problem: the wind or engine as motivation was the crux of my previous condition.

I realize that a person's motivation is very much like a **supply system needed for navigation**. We invest time, attention, and emotion like fresh water and fuel, expecting to exchange them for three things: meaning (**charts and celestial markers**), echo (**lighthouses or echoes from the shore**), and sensation (**the state of the ship itself**). When this balance of income and expenditure is disrupted... the **supply cycle** of my ship is interrupted.

For me, its essence is a Lacanian **desire economy** that can circulate, and this economy **went bankrupt** before, breaking the chain of meaning.

For example, I once chatted with a friend who earned a year's salary by trading stocks. I said I felt he didn't truly like money, because if he did, he should quit his job or at least spend more effort on stocks, yet he was still working hard.
So clearly, for him, his chain of meaning was not:
```
Stock trading -> Wealth -> Security -> Freedom -> Satisfaction
```

Analyzing carefully, there's much to ponder here: on one hand, making money from stocks doesn't mean stock trading can always create wealth, or wealth that guarantees a worry-free life. On the other hand, the freedom brought by money doesn't necessarily mean satisfaction; it's very possible that for him, being recognized by others, being acknowledged by society, brings satisfaction. I have no intention of psychoanalyzing him here, so I can stop at this.

Human motivation is often not driven by a certain "fact," but by a string of "narratives." One word leads to another, one explanation leads to another: success leads to recognition, recognition leads to value, value leads to security. Meaning connects backward like a chain; we think we are chasing a goal, but in reality, we are constantly moving backward on this chain. The chain makes life understandable, but when it loses places to "pause temporarily," a person enters a state of interpretive overload: the more one thinks, the faster one overturns, yet the harder it becomes to act.

But there is something even more subtle: what keeps this chain running is often not the goal itself, but that little **indescribable lure** behind the goal—a look of recognition, a stable position, a gap of "almost getting it." A person can change projects, cities, relationships; the things pursued on the surface may change, but that little lure often reappears repeatedly. Understanding it is not for self-blame, but to see clearly: what exactly is pulling me, where is overdrawing happening, where do I need to rearrange my sources of feedback.

With this illustrative example, I can now diagnose: for my previous self, the chain of meaning was:
```
Logistical work -> System stability -> Smooth team operation -> Being acknowledged -> Sense of value
```
This chain was once the **invisible anchor chain** of my ship, one end tied to my work, the other cast into the harbor of external recognition. It made me willing to invest long hours because I believed the path of return existed: as long as the system was stable, the team operated smoothly; as long as the team operated smoothly, I would be needed, acknowledged; as long as I was acknowledged, I had a sense of value.

And when the main narrative was reset, the fixed point of the harbor disappeared, and the anchor chain clattered, sinking into nothingness. Tasks were still plentiful, but the middle two links of the chain lost their guarantee: my continued investment did not necessarily lead to the visible result of "smooth team operation," let alone necessarily lead to "being acknowledged." So, I began to withdraw investment; withdrawal made the system harder to advance; greater difficulty in advancement further weakened meaning; the cycle ultimately went bankrupt.

If borrowing a psychoanalytic formula:

> Desire = Demand - Need, is a surplus.

For me, the "surplus" is not at the material level, but at the feedback level: what I need is not just completing tasks (need), nor just responding to demands (demand), but that little surplus of "being placed on this chain"—being acknowledged, witnessed, incorporated into a sustainable circuit of meaning. When this surplus disappears, motivation dries up.

This is not a moral problem, nor an intellectual problem, but the rupture of an economic cycle: in the past, I handed over the issuance rights of my desire economy to external order. Once external order malfunctioned, I could only go bankrupt.
## Reconstruction

Just as debt restructuring in the real-world economy can be a good opportunity to regroup, when the belief in my mind that "the external world will inevitably guarantee meaning for me" collapsed, pain was unavoidable. But closely following the pain came the opportunity for change, the possibility of truly taking charge of my own desire economy, personally forging my own chain of meaning, thereby becoming a politically mature person.

Like this sentence by Calvino:

> The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.

I now understand this sentence as follows: the inferno is the human world. When you open your eyes and find that your entire life has lost an anchor, you discover the inferno, and this inferno is your life itself. At this point, you have two choices:

The first option: You acknowledge the existence of this inferno and surrender, then slide into nihilism: nothing a person does is worthwhile, start living for the moment because life is short; or worse, simply become a cynical misanthrope; or deny the existence of the inferno, find a more stable external order for yourself, let this external order provide a strong guarantee for you, then issue commands to you, thus pretending this inferno doesn't exist.

Or there is the second option: You acknowledge the existence of this inferno but do not surrender. With a mature attitude, utilize the order mechanism that previously drove you forward, and after recognizing that it is man-made, revisable, and requires bearing consequences, create a new order, **load the aforementioned chain of meaning and economic system into it**, and then act.

The second option is almost the action plan I mentioned above, but what was missing in the previous thinking was a new chain of meaning that could carry the economic cycle of desire, one that could be repaired, accumulated, and adjusted with the participation of my own subjectivity. It could be said that I expected a correct result but didn't know how to reach it at the time.

The previously stuck "absolute action plan" was generally correct in direction but sounded very intimidating, seemingly requiring a thorough transformation. Now it seems that this posture itself is not problematic, but there is some inversion within it: the goal shifted from **pursuing a guideline derived from metaphysical contemplation that descends into daily life and guides it** (which can be incomplete and must be incomplete) to **pursuing a closed, complete symbolic order to avoid uncertainty**. The difference lies in that if one pursues completeness, this process will never end, so thinking becomes a means of procrastination, falling into the eternal oscillating thinking I previously criticized.

My current solution is that the key to reconstruction is not "finding a perfect answer," but adopting a simpler, more executable posture:

**I choose a desired future, make a promise to myself, and bear its cost; others can only be witnesses and collaborators, no longer absolute guarantors.**

This sentence sounds like a slogan, but when implemented, it is actually very concrete: it means I must allow uncertainty to continue to exist, allow plans to go live at seventy percent, allow correction through action; it also means I have to pay the price for my choices, not indefinitely postpone the cost with "let me think about it some more."

After all, pessimists are correct, optimists succeed.

### Summary

Combining all the key concerns of this article, specifically:

Recognize that the promised land—that is, stable life, anchors of thought, or stability guaranteed by grand external narratives and large-scale orders—does not exist. In other words: external order is not self-consistent and will not forever guarantee for me.
