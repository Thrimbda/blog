"title": "The Adventure of Rudder and Wind: From Lost to Rebuilding a Personal Meaning System"
"summary": "Using the metaphor of a ship and voyage, this article reflects on the author's state of being 'unwilling to do anything' in 2025. The author analyzes that this state stemmed from long-term reliance on external responsibility-driven motivation (such as team support work). When the external order was reset, the original chain of meaning broke, leading to a loss of drive. The article delves into the differences and balance between responsibility-driven and interest-driven motivation, critiques the 'pleasure of thinking' caused by overthinking, and points out that the real solution is not to pursue a perfect symbolic order, but to rebuild a personal meaning system by taking risks and formulating correctable action plans. The author ultimately proposes that one must bear the cost oneself and find meaning in action, rather than relying on external guarantees."

> Perhaps my 2025 summary?

If a person is like a ship, then reason is its rudder and sails, while desire is the engine driving it forward, or the wind.

The wind cannot push a ship without sails, nor can a ship move forward by rudder alone.

By the end of May 2025, I had fallen into a certain condition, leaving my ship adrift in the vast ocean, motionless. No direction, no wind.

This is my description and reflection on that state at the time. I didn't reach any conclusions then; I just wanted to understand what was wrong with me, to analyze my own inner world.

## The Condition

From late May to August 2025, I was somewhat lost, trapped in a state of being "unwilling to do anything." I wasn't clear about the cause of this state at the time. Looking back later, I could only retrospectively construct the reason from some clues. In other words, depending on the present situation, these explanations might be vastly different.

If I must trace it back, perhaps it's because I had long been accustomed to serving as the logistical role within the team, providing infrastructure construction, completion, and daily maintenance. Over the years, my accustomed work mode was to receive rather than give, driven by responsibility rather than interest. Over time, my spirit was somewhat worn down, leaving me feeling exhausted and confused.

### Two Types of Motivation: Responsibility vs. Interest

> Borrowing a bit of psychoanalytic language, they roughly correspond to two common subject positions: one leans more toward "being driven by external order," and the other leans more toward "being pulled by internal interest." But I won't strictly correspond them here; I'll just borrow them to illustrate the difference.

Specifically, the difference between these two motivations is that responsibility-driven motivation means meaning exists outside the subject, completing an existing order to make it more whole; whereas interest-driven motivation means meaning is bestowed by the subject itself, creating a new order. Therefore, after the team's main tasks were recently reset to an "initial state," the meaning of the various responsibilities that originally constituted the order's main thread was dissolved. This resulted in a situation where, despite many things that could be done, I was unwilling to do them or did them slowly.

I believe these two motivations should occupy a person's time and energy in a balanced way. Tilting the scale too far toward either end can cause trouble. Excessive responsibility can make a person run ragged, eventually looking back and not knowing what they were busy with; the most severe consequence is losing a sense of meaning. Excessive interest can easily lead to working behind closed doors, isolating oneself from the external world without realizing it, ignoring many external signals while focusing only on one's inner world, ultimately still having to deal with the relationship with the external world's order. Retrospectively summarizing now, over the past period, these two motivations were indeed imbalanced in me.

Analyzing it this way, one could think the problem has been understood. For me, to emerge from this lost, motivation-lacking state, I need to re-establish a set of order myself, assign meaning to various issues, so that various matters regain their attributes of "priority and urgency."

#### Systematic Thinking

A temporary slowdown in pace isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as it facilitates some outcomes of thinking that help re-establish order.

This thinking must be systematic to distinguish fantasy from genuine thinking. I describe a thinking process like this: a person draws a conclusion on how to act—an action plan—based on various favorable and unfavorable conditions in their current situation. This action plan must withstand scrutiny from various angles to judge whether it is reasonable and tenable. If reasonable, then action should logically follow; otherwise, a new conclusion will replace the previous incomplete and immature one. This process can be repeated until reaching an **absolute**, unchanging state.

This action plan is the inevitable result of the subject bearing the weight of life. Scarcity produces desire, and desire drives the subject to constantly attempt to symbolize the real world. However, a person cannot integrate themselves into a "perfect" symbolic order and become static matter because the world cannot be static. A person absolutely cannot articulate what their symbolic essence specifically is. Since God died (or people finally realized God never existed), humans can no longer grasp their own essence (or rather, the essence that once existed was an illusion). Only the subject exists, needing to notice every moment that the real world has changed, accept and understand it, then re-register it into the symbolic system—just like an oil film on flowing water constantly changing color, trying to completely cover the water surface. This action plan points to a future. As this future pulls the subject toward itself, the subject is constantly reborn, not decaying, not dying.

#### Abandoning Thinking?

We need to consider a possibility: **Is it possible for a person to abandon thinking?**

First, complete abandonment means giving up formulating any action plan. But from the moment of birth, a person can no longer return to the mythical state of desirelessness before birth. Various scarcities, from physiological to psychological, drive a person to do something to fill these lacks. Therefore, completely abandoning thinking is impossible.

#### Thinking Forever?

Is there a possibility that this thinking forever oscillates in a state of fluctuation?

Of course, this possibility exists. Behind this recursive behavior of constantly overturning previous thinking is the subject's refusal to finally specify an action plan, refusal to acknowledge a future's existence. Then, time becomes meaningless to the subject. This cycle—it is essentially a cyclical escape, evading the responsibility of being an existent, finding pleasure in this cycle. Admittedly, this pleasure is quite attractive; otherwise, why would there be so many people addicted to scrolling through TikTok?

#### My Critique

Being lost is shameful because there are no people who don't live in the real world. If a person is not being kept, then based on their own situation, they are first forced to act; otherwise, they will starve.

## Looking Back

At that point, I got stuck. The original next chapter was "Action Plan," which should have described a goal I could be loyal to after the deep thinking mentioned above, and how to act at every moment based on this goal. But I ultimately didn't write it; at least, I didn't arrive at such an action plan at that time. So, after leaving a critique, this article was shelved. I believe the reason wasn't that I lost reason, nor that there was something wrong with my ship's performance itself, but that I lost the wind, lost motivation.

I tried to anchor myself through absolute thinking, seeking a "perfect" action plan to end all uncertainty. But this precisely plunged me into the "pleasure of thinking"—constantly deducing and overturning, replacing real choices with speculative oscillations. I later understood that this itself was part of the symptom: when external meaning guarantees failed, I fantasized about replacing them by introspectively constructing a complete symbolic order. This was doomed to fail because **the endpoint of thinking is not a perfect answer, but the determination to take responsibility**.

I increasingly believe that all philosophy must move toward practice. Zarathustra must descend the mountain; the person who leaves the cave must return to the cave—not to repeat the enlightenment narrative, but because only in the friction of the human world can thought be realized.
Therefore, what I need to end is not thinking itself, but that oscillation that finds pleasure in overturning and safety in hesitation: it made me seem to approach truth while actually avoiding responsibility.
I want to change to another life posture: first implement a phased direction into action, then use the results of action to correct the direction; let reality be the judge, let contradictions drive progress, not keep me spinning in place.

And now I am already moving forward at full capacity and need to further optimize efficiency at the rational level, so I am picking up this previous article to complete it.

## Diagnosis
> Desire = Demand - Need. It is a surplus.

This is how I think about this problem: the wind or engine as motivation was the crux of my previous condition.

I realize that human motivation is much like a **provisioning system required for navigation**. We invest time, attention, and emotion like fresh water and fuel, expecting to get three things in return: meaning (**charts and celestial markers**), echo (**lighthouses or echoes from the shore**), and sensation (**the state of the ship itself**). When this balance of income and expenditure is disrupted... the **provisioning cycle** of my ship is interrupted.

For me, its essence is a Lacanian **desire economy** that can cycle, and this economy had previously **gone bankrupt**.

Human motivation is often not driven by a certain "fact," but by a string of "narratives." One word leads to another, one explanation leads to another: success leads to recognition, recognition leads to value, value leads to security. Meaning links backward like a chain; we think we are chasing a goal, but actually we are constantly moving backward on this chain. The chain makes life understandable, but when it loses places to "pause temporarily," a person enters a state of explanatory overload: the more one thinks, the faster one overturns, yet the harder it is to act.

But there is something even more hidden: what keeps this chain running is often not the goal itself, but that little **indescribable lure** behind the goal—a look of recognition, a stable position, a gap of "almost getting it." A person can change projects, cities, relationships; the surface things chased will change, but that little lure often reappears repeatedly. Understanding it is not for self-blame, but to see clearly: what exactly is pulling me, where am I overdrawing, where do I need to rearrange my sources of feedback?

For example, I once chatted with a friend who earned a year's salary by trading stocks. I said I felt he didn't really like money, because if he did, he should quit his job or at least spend more effort on stocks, yet he was still working hard.
So clearly, for him, his chain of meaning was not:
```
Stock trading -> Wealth -> Security -> Freedom -> Satisfaction
```
Analyzing carefully, there's much to ponder here: on one hand, making money from stocks doesn't mean stock trading can always create wealth, or wealth that guarantees a lifetime of衣食无忧. On the other hand, the freedom brought by money doesn't necessarily mean satisfaction; for him, being recognized by others, being acknowledged by society, might bring satisfaction. I don't intend to psychoanalyze him here, so I can stop here.

With this illustrative example, I can now diagnose: for the previous me, the chain of meaning was:
```
Support work -> System stability -> Team runs smoothly -> Being acknowledged -> Sense of value
```
This chain was once the **invisible anchor chain** of my ship, one end tied to my work, the other cast into the harbor of external recognition. When the main thread was reset, the fixed point in the harbor disappeared, the anchor chain clattered and sank into nothingness, and the ship began to drift helplessly.

And when the overarching goal around which this chain itself revolved was reset to zero, the middle two links of this chain lost their guarantee, the meaning of responsibility was dissolved, making no difference whether to do or not. There were still many tasks, but each seemed like a side quest. By inertia, I should still contribute, but the returns became extremely uncertain, so I tended to withdraw investment, and thus the economy stalled.

## Reconstruction

Just like bailouts in the real-world economy, sometimes debt restructuring is a good opportunity to regroup. When the belief in my mind that "the external world will inevitably guarantee meaning for me" collapsed, pain was unavoidable. But closely following the pain came the opportunity for change, the possibility of truly taking charge of my own desire economy, forging my own chain of meaning, thereby becoming a politically mature person.

Like this quote from Calvino:

> The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.

I now understand this quote this way: hell is the human world. When you open your eyes and find that your entire life has lost an anchor, you discover hell, and this hell is your life itself. At this point, you have two choices:

The first option: You acknowledge this hell exists and surrender, then slide into nihilism: nothing a person does is worthwhile, start living for the moment because life is short; or worse, simply become a cynical misanthrope; or deny the hell exists, find a more solid external order for yourself, let this external order provide a strong guarantee for you, then issue commands to you, thus pretending this hell doesn't exist.

Or there is a second option: You acknowledge this hell exists but do not surrender. With a mature attitude, use the order mechanism that previously drove you forward, recognizing that it is man-made, revisable, and requires bearing consequences, create a new order, **load the aforementioned chain of meaning and economic system into it**, and then act.

The second option is almost the action plan I mentioned above, but what was missing in the previous thinking was a new chain of meaning that could carry the economic cycle of desire, one that could be revised, accumulated, and adjusted with my own subject's participation. It could be said that I expected a correct outcome but didn't know how to reach it at the time.

Moreover, the previous "absolute action plan" sounded very intimidating; it seemed to demand a thorough transformation. Now it seems this posture itself isn't problematic, but there is some inversion in it: the goal shifted from **pursuing a guideline derived from metaphysical contemplation that descends into daily life and guides it** (which can be incomplete and necessarily is incomplete) to **pursuing a closed, complete symbolic order to avoid uncertainty**. The difference is that if you pursue completeness, this process never ends, so thinking becomes a means of procrastination, falling into the eternal oscillating thinking I previously criticized.

My solution is: I choose a desired future, make a promise to myself, and bear its cost; the Other can only be a witness/collaborator, not guaranteeing an absolute.

### Summary

Combining all the key concerns of this article, specifically:

Recognize that the promised land—that is, stable life, anchors of thought, or the stability guaranteed by grand external narratives and large-scale orders—does not exist. In other words: external order is not self-consistent and will not forever guarantee things for me.

At this point, you can consider yourself "dead": your position in the symbolic order is dead—old identity, old titles, old meanings, the old "who I am" has collapsed (expelled, canceled, negated by yourself). This process is usually accompanied by fear and anxiety.

But, do not retreat into old fantasies, do not seek a new absolute and new guarantee, do not stagnate, and do not use some self-destructive action to end everything.

What to do is: take risks yourself, calculate risks yourself, thereby plan an action plan, faithfully execute its principles. The person is still acting; the difference is bearing the cost oneself; action itself is meaning.

It's like your ship has set sail, and suddenly you realize the ship isn't as perfect as the pre-departure inspection report described. You discover some flaws, like sudden weather changes, like some engine trouble. What should be done is still to find ways to adjust operations to move toward the既定 goal, while being prepared for death. At this point, panicking and becoming numb, doing nothing, or despairingly seeking death directly are both wrong.

Therefore, a truly commendable solution can be a bit hasty; it should give clear answers to already clear problems, make arbitrary cuts on some still unclear issues. It can be easily overturned and revised in details and implementation, but it will never waver on already understood problems. But this solution must be able to adapt to local conditions and changing circumstances to answer most questions. Its overturning and restarting is not hitting a wall and turning back, but constantly encountering the friction of reality, realizing some things might be wrong, then correcting direction in iteration.

I like a line from *The "Mary Gloster"*:
> They copied all they could follow, but they couldn't copy my mind,  
> And I left 'em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind.

This line seems to say: others can copy what you do, but they can't copy how you think, how you reignite yourself.  
Continue as a ship, keep sailing, keep thinking, keep acting.
