"summary": "This article, from Bryan's perspective, depicts the delayed nature of sorrow. Sorrow is described as a warm fluid, sloshing in the chest and corroding the heart, akin to pain simmering over a low heat. Memory acts as a spooky action at a distance, stirring this pot of abyssal soup. When the door to the cellar filled with discarded memories is opened, the brewed ghosts surge forth with the scent of both pleasure and resentment, causing Bryan to lose himself in time, unable to distinguish past from present. The article references Keats' 'Ode on Melancholy,' further deepening the theme of sorrow intertwined with beauty and joy. Ultimately, Bryan realizes the bleakness of human nature caught between gods and beasts, yet he remains an unwitting sacrifice to this spiraling tragedy."

Bryan never imagined that sorrow could also have a delayed nature—the ghosts of the past have come calling again, and this time, he no longer has the strength to resist.

If asked to describe the **shape of sorrow** now, he would say it's like a fluid, contained within his chest, sloshing as he walks, spilling a little to corrode his heart. When lying down, it flows steadily, only trembling in sync with his heartbeat.

As for its temperature, it's certainly not cold; it's warm, slightly hotter than the temperature of his chest, continuously releasing heat to slowly roast his heart. The sensation is like... simmering over a low heat, stewing together with pain, yet never fully cooked. His active nerves persistently remind him of the taste of **pain**.

There is only one kind of spooky action at a distance in this world—the **memories** that stir this pot of abyssal soup from the back of his head. After brewing and fermenting for over a year alongside a fate as fragile as raindrops on duckweed, the moment he opened the door to this cellar filled with discarded memories, the brewed ghosts, carrying the warm, sweet scent of pleasure and the odor of resentment, surged up and struck him like a heavy blow—a reaction that, in my view, is truly shameful, or to put it plainly, shameful to the point of utter humiliation. I have never seen him like this before. Once sincere, confident, youthful, and candid, he is now lost in the flow of time. He can no longer distinguish which events are happening now, which happened two years ago, or which he thought occurred yesterday but have actually been over for a year. These **memories**, which he believed he had long lost over the past year, have ultimately dispersed among all other orderly memories in such a vividly clear form, infecting them like cancer. Even earlier, cleaner memories have now begun to take on sharp edges, wandering through his mind.

Unfortunately, poor Bryan is merely a pitiful one-dimensional temporal being, unaware that his mind, at certain moments, merely serves as a medium for transmitting messages, delivering ancient information to his self after countless iterations, all while engaging in foolish acts of confidence tinged with faint sorrow. At this moment, he finally realizes the **bleakness** of human nature, caught between gods and beasts, yet he remains uncontrollably destined to be a sacrifice to this spiraling tragedy.

Ode on Melancholy

BY JOHN KEATS


No, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist
       Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;
Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd
       By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine;
               Make not your rosary of yew-berries,
       Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be
               Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl
A partner in your sorrow's mysteries;
       For shade to shade will come too drowsily,
               And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.

But when the melancholy fit shall fall
       Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,
That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,
       And hides the green hill in an April shroud;
Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,
       Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,
               Or on the wealth of globed peonies;
Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,
       Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,
               And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.

She dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die;
       And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips
Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,
       Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:
Ay, in the very temple of Delight
       Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine,
               Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue
       Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;
His soul shalt taste the sadness of her might,
               And be among her cloudy trophies hung.
```

Now he is filled with desolation, poor Bryan.
