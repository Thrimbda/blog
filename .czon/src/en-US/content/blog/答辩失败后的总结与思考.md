Five hours have passed. After the defense ended, I felt as if a layer of skin had been stripped off, overwhelmed with shame. Silently riding my bicycle, I disappeared into the sycamore-lined path. Fortunately, there was no one around—only strangers—giving me a moment to catch my breath.

Escape.

That was indeed the thought I couldn't immediately put into words. I feared any possibility of self-deception.

So I need to think: Where exactly did things go wrong?

## The Defense

We included Light, the online judging platform we had been working on and which fascinated me, in our application for the university innovation project. To gain support, or perhaps to pressure ourselves, we went ahead with it. Ah Zheng asked me to be the lead for this project, responsible for handling related matters. After hastily submitting the application, I learned that the project defense was scheduled for noon today, and I had two days to prepare.

So, at noon today, I suffered a crushing defeat. The judges gave me the impression that they had no idea what I was talking about, thinking I was being fanciful, making things up, trying to pitch some nonsensical, imaginary project to scam funding.

Where did the problem lie?

### External Factors

A total of eight groups defended their projects today, and I was the last one. The judges were indeed not professional, even giving off a sense of condescension based on seniority. But can they shoulder the blame?

No. If our product is meant for the public, it must be simple enough, easy enough to understand and use. Therefore, if even judges in the relevant field couldn't digest and comprehend it, then it must be a poorly defined product.

So, let's think further: Where did the problem lie?

### Surface-Level Issues

Clearly, something was wrong with my PPT style. During the Q&A session after the presentation, the judges spent half their time pointing out issues with the PPT. Presumably, this problem was the most直观 and the most irritating.

This was caused by a belief I had increasingly held over recent defenses: that the PPT should outline key points, while the content should be delivered primarily through speech.

That in itself isn't a problem, but this time I almost fell into a pathological obsession: only titles, no body text, not even complete content.

Simplicity isn't the issue; the issue is being crude.

No data, no charts, no examples—I had none of the things that could clarify points and make the presentation clearer.

But was it just the PPT that ruined this defense? I'm afraid it's not that simple.

### Communication Skills

I am deeply aware of my weakness: severely inadequate communication skills. But do I truly understand this?

Even with a PPT like mine, with proper delivery, it might still have been possible to explain things clearly for this defense.

Lack of coherence in language, poor logical flow, incomplete expression—on top of that, I stammered, forgot my words. All fatal flaws.

Thus, the surface-level PPT problem exposed my shortcomings in communication.

But can these shortcomings be changed? I believe they can. However, knowing full well I had these weaknesses, I didn't take appropriate measures to prevent them from being exposed—I could have.

What else?

### Understanding of the Project

Actually, I had a similar defense experience during the Chengdu training. The PPT that time wasn't as extreme as this one, and my delivery was much better. I believe the secret then was that, as the project manager, I had a comprehensive grasp: I did the detailed design of the entire system, understood every aspect of the API server design and the reasons behind them. I clearly knew what kind of system I was building, who it was for, and its potential future development.

But this time was different. I don't think I fully understood Ah Zheng's vision for the entire system: the analysis of users' latent needs, the definition of the system, and its future, especially its developmental prospects.

### The Root Cause

Ultimately, where did the problem lie?

**Lack of dedication.**

If I had delved deeply into the entire project and formed my own profound understanding;
If I had rehearsed before the defense;
If my PPT had contained more substance;
This defense likely wouldn't have been such an ugly mess.

**In short, I feel ashamed.**

Diligence can compensate for shortcomings, not tranquility leading to distant goals. I hope I can remember this.

## Reflections

After dinner, carrying my glasses and a bottle of soy milk, I took a walk around campus. North of the library, I found a small garden where I could think quietly.

There, I summarized why my defense turned into a complete mess and also pondered what a good product should be like.

### A Thought Experiment

Newton said he was just a child picking up shells by the great ocean of truth, while we are a species with an infinite thirst for knowledge.

I believe there are two types of pioneers on the journey of exploration:

+ Creators of technology
+ Implementers of technology

The first type builds lofty foundations, worthy of remembrance, worthy of being recorded in history, serving as the pride of their era and a beacon for history thereafter, providing the possibility for progress. The second type thinks deeply and thoroughly enough to connect technology and people in a natural and harmonious way, truly realizing progress.

— Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction; Edison and Tesla created the entire electrical age.

****

Therefore, I define a good product as follows:

​	**It satisfies a basic human need, is sufficiently convenient to use, and becomes a bridge connecting technology and humanity.**

### Returning to the Starting Point

I looked up at the towering sycamore trees. Everything has structure.

How do we abstract, model, and analyze the intrinsic connections of things? How do we see the essence beneath surface phenomena?

The society formed by people also has structure. The angle and depth of thinking, as well as the mastery of information resources, are also ways of delineating structure. If everyone is born the same, then education provides the ladder for structural change. However, this still cannot resolve the contradictions arising from information asymmetry. For example, people at the higher levels of this structure and those at the lower levels can almost only communicate through media—analogous to a C/S architecture. Currently, there is no efficient method to match information seekers with relevant providers (peer to peer).

**Perhaps Light can solve this kind of problem? That remains to be explored.**
