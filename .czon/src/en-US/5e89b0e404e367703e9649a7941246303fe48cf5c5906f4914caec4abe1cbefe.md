# Research CZON Embla Carousel and Modify get-gcores-talk.ts - Task List

## Quick Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 4 - Testing & Verification
**Current Task**: (none)
**Progress**: 10/10 Tasks Completed

---

## Phase 1: Research & Analysis 🟡 IN PROGRESS

- [x] Analyze CZON's Embla implementation in detail (JavaScript, CSS, HTML) | Acceptance: Understand the loading, initialization, and grouping logic of Embla in CZON, document key code snippets
- [x] Analyze the current blog's template structure and existing slider implementation | Acceptance: Clarify the implementation method of the existing slider, identify template file locations and script loading order
- [x] Determine the integration plan (whether to replace the existing slider, how to add Embla) | Acceptance: Formulate a specific integration plan, including Embla script insertion location, CSS addition method, and compatibility decisions with the existing slider

---

## Phase 2: Modify get-gcores-talk.ts 🟡 IN PROGRESS

- [x] Modify the image output logic to generate tiled markdown image rows | Acceptance: get-gcores-talk.ts outputs consecutive markdown image rows, one image per line, removing the slideshow macro

---

## Phase 3: Integrate Embla into Blog Template 🟡 IN PROGRESS

- [x] Add the Embla library loading script to the template | Acceptance: Add CDN script tags for Embla and Embla Autoplay to the appropriate template file (e.g., base.html or blog-page.html)
- [x] Add Embla initialization JavaScript code | Acceptance: Add initialization script similar to CZON's, ensuring it can automatically group consecutive images into a carousel
- [x] Add the required CSS styles for Embla | Acceptance: Add CZON's Embla CSS styles to the blog's CSS file or embed them via a style tag

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Verification 🟡 IN PROGRESS

- [x] Run the script to generate test content and check the output format | Acceptance: Execute get-gcores-talk.ts to generate a markdown file, confirm the image row format is correct
- [x] Build the blog and verify carousel functionality | Acceptance: Use `zola build` or `serve` to preview the blog, confirm the carousel works correctly and images are swipeable
- [x] Ensure compatibility with existing functionality | Acceptance: Verify that existing slider functionality (e.g., slideshow shortcode in other articles) is unaffected, or decide whether to replace it ← CURRENT
