"title": "Lost and Rebuilt in 2025: From Responsibility-Driven to Self-Meaning Construction"
"summary": "This article documents the author's state of being 'unwilling to do anything' from May to August 2025. Through in-depth analysis, the author discovered the root cause was a long-term reliance on external responsibility as a driver. When the team's main tasks were reset, causing the external guarantee of meaning to fail, the original chain of meaning broke, and the motivational system stalled. The article distinguishes between responsibility-driven and interest-driven modes, pointing out that over-reliance on either leads to problems. The author ultimately realized that one cannot escape uncertainty by pursuing a perfect symbolic order. Instead, one must accept the imperfection of reality, take personal risks to construct new chains of meaning, and continuously adjust direction through action to rebuild motivation. The core of the solution is shifting from the 'pleasure of thinking' to the 'determination to take responsibility,' letting reality be the judge and cashing in ideas through practice."

> Could this be my 2025 summary?

If a person is like a ship, then reason is its rudder and sails, while desire is the engine driving the ship forward, or the wind.

The wind cannot push a ship without sails, nor can a ship move forward by rudder alone.

At the end of May 2025, I fell into a certain condition, leaving my ship adrift and motionless on the vast ocean. No direction, no wind.

This is my description and reflection on that state at the time. I didn't reach any conclusions then; I just wanted to understand what was wrong with me, to analyze my inner self.

## The Symptom

From late May to August 2025, I was somewhat lost, trapped in a state of "unwillingness to do anything." I wasn't clear about the cause of this state at the time. Looking back later, I could only retroactively construct the reason from some clues. In other words, depending on the current situation, these explanations might be vastly different.

If I must trace it back, perhaps it's because I had long been accustomed to serving as a support role within the team, providing infrastructure construction, completion, and daily maintenance. Over the years, my accustomed work mode was one of receiving rather than giving, driven by responsibility rather than interest. Over time, my spirit was somewhat worn down, leaving me feeling tired and confused.

### Two Driving Forces: Responsibility vs. Interest

> If I borrow a bit of psychoanalytic language, they roughly correspond to two common subject positions: one leans more towards being "driven by external order," the other more towards being "pulled by internal interest." But I won't strictly correspond them here; I'll just use them to illustrate the difference.

Specifically, the difference between these two driving forces is: responsibility-driven means meaning exists outside the subject, completing an existing order to make it more whole; while interest-driven means meaning is bestowed by the subject itself, creating a new order. Therefore, after the team's main tasks were recently reset to an "initial state," the meaning of the various responsibilities that constituted the original order's main thread was dissolved. This resulted in a situation where, despite many things that could be done, I was unwilling to do them or did them slowly.

I believe these two driving forces should occupy a person's time and energy in a balanced way. Leaning too heavily towards either end of the scale can cause trouble. Excessive responsibility can make a person run ragged, eventually looking back and not knowing what they were busy with; the most severe consequence is losing a sense of meaning. Excessive interest can easily lead to working behind closed doors, isolating oneself from the external world without realizing it, ignoring many external signals while focusing only on one's inner world, ultimately still having to deal with the relationship with the external world's order. Retrospectively summarizing now, over the past period, these two driving forces were indeed imbalanced within me.

Analyzing it this way, one could consider the problem already understood. For me, to emerge from this lost, motivation-lacking state, I need to re-establish a set of order myself, assign meaning to various issues, so that all things regain their attributes of "priority and urgency."

#### Systematic Thinking

A temporary slowdown in pace isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as it can facilitate some outcomes of thought, helping to re-establish order.

This thinking must be systematic, so as to distinguish fantasy from genuine thought. I describe a thinking process like this: a person, based on various favorable and unfavorable conditions in their current situation, arrives at a conclusion about how to act—a course of action. This course of action must withstand scrutiny from various angles to judge whether it is reasonable and tenable. If reasonable, then action should follow logically; otherwise, a new conclusion will replace the previous incomplete, immature one. This process can be repeated until reaching an **absolute**, unchanging state.

This course of action is the inevitable result of the subject bearing the weight of life. Scarcity produces desire, and desire drives the subject to constantly attempt to symbolize the real world. However, a person cannot integrate themselves into a "perfect" symbolic order and become static matter, because the world cannot be static. A person can never definitively state what their symbolic essence specifically is. Since God died (or since people finally realized God never existed), humans can no longer grasp their own essence (or rather, the essence that once existed was an illusion). Only the subject exists, needing to notice every moment that the real world has changed, accept and understand it, then re-register it into the symbolic system—just like an oil film on flowing water constantly changing its hue, trying to completely cover the water's surface. This course of action points to a future. As this future pulls the subject towards itself, the subject is constantly reborn, rather than decaying, rather than dying.

#### Abandoning Thought?

We need to consider a possibility: **Is it possible for a person to abandon thought?**

First, complete abandonment means giving up on formulating any course of action. But from the moment of birth, a person can no longer return to the mythical state of desirelessness before birth. Various scarcities, from physiological to psychological, drive a person to do something to fill these lacks. Therefore, completely abandoning thought is impossible.

#### Thinking Forever?

Is there a possibility that this thinking forever oscillates in a state of swaying?

Of course, this possibility exists. Behind this recursive behavior of constantly overturning previous thought is the subject's refusal to finally designate a course of action, refusal to acknowledge a future exists. Then, time becomes meaningless to the subject. This cycle—it is essentially a cyclical escape, evading the responsibility of being an existent, finding pleasure in this cycle. Admittedly, this pleasure holds considerable attraction; otherwise, why would there be so many people addicted to scrolling through TikTok?

#### My Critique

Being lost is shameful because there are no people who live detached from worldly affairs. If a person is not being kept, then based on their own situation, they are first forced to act; otherwise, they will starve.

## Looking Back

At that point, I got stuck. The original next chapter was "Course of Action," which should have described a goal I could be loyal to after the deep thinking mentioned above, and how to act at every moment based on working backwards from that goal. But I ultimately didn't write it; at least, I didn't arrive at such a course of action at that time. So, after leaving that critique, this article was shelved. I believe the reason wasn't that I lost my reason, nor that there was something wrong with the performance of my ship itself. It was that I lost the wind, lost motivation.

I tried to anchor myself through absolute thinking, seeking a "perfect" course of action to end all uncertainty. But this precisely plunged me into the "pleasure of thinking"—constantly deducing and overturning, replacing real choices with the oscillation of speculation. I only realized later that this itself was part of the symptom: when the external guarantee of meaning failed, I fantasized about replacing it by constructing a complete symbolic order through introspection. This was doomed to fail because **the endpoint of thinking is not a perfect answer, but the determination to take responsibility**.

I increasingly believe that all philosophy must move towards practice. Zarathustra must descend the mountain; the person who leaves the cave must also return to the cave—not to repeat the narrative of enlightenment, but because it is only in the friction of the human world that thought is cashed in.
Therefore, what I need to end is not thinking itself, but that oscillation that finds pleasure in overturning and safety in hesitation: it made me seem to be approaching truth, while actually avoiding commitment.
I want to adopt another posture towards life: first implement a phased direction into action, then use the results of action to correct the direction; let reality be the judge, let contradictions drive progress, rather than letting me spin in place.

And now I am already moving forward at full capacity and need to further optimize efficiency at the rational level. Therefore, I am now picking up this previous article to complete it.

## Diagnosis
> Desire = Demand - Need. It is a surplus.

This is how I think about this problem: the wind or engine as motivation was the crux of my previous condition.

I realize that a person's motivation is much like a **provisioning system required for navigation**. We invest time, attention, and emotion like fresh water and fuel, expecting to get three things in return: meaning (**charts and celestial markers**), echo (**lighthouses or echoes from the shore**), and sensation (**the state of the ship itself**). When this balance of income and expenditure is disrupted... my ship's **provisioning cycle** is interrupted.

For me, its essence is a Lacanian **economy of desire** that can circulate, and this economy **went bankrupt** before.

Human motivation is often not driven by a certain "fact," but by a string of "discourse." One word leads to another, one explanation leads to another: success leads to recognition, recognition leads to value, value leads to security. Meaning links up like a chain; we think we are chasing a goal, but actually we are constantly moving backward on this chain. The chain makes life understandable, but when it loses places to "pause temporarily," a person enters a state of interpretive overload: the more one thinks, the faster one overturns, yet the harder it is to act.

But there is something even more hidden: what keeps this chain running is often not the goal itself, but that little bit of **indescribable lure** behind the goal—a look of recognition, a stable position, a gap of "almost getting it." A person can change projects, cities, relationships; the surface things chased will change, but that little lure often reappears repeatedly. Understanding it is not for self-blame, but to see clearly: what exactly is pulling me, where am I overdrawing, where do I need to rearrange my sources of feedback?

For example, I once chatted with a friend who earned a year's salary by trading stocks. I said I felt he didn't really like money, because if he did, he should quit his job, or at least spend more effort on stocks, yet he was still working hard.
So clearly, for him, his chain of meaning was not:
```
Stock trading -> Wealth -> Security -> Freedom -> Satisfaction
```
Analyzing carefully, there's much to ponder here: on one hand, making money from stocks doesn't equal stocks always creating wealth, or wealth that guarantees a lifetime of衣食无忧. On the other hand, the freedom brought by money doesn't necessarily mean satisfaction. It's very possible that for him, being recognized by others, being acknowledged by society, brings satisfaction. I don't intend to psychoanalyze him here, so I can stop here.

With this illustrative example, I can now diagnose: for the previous me, the chain of meaning was:
```
Support work -> System stability -> Team runs smoothly -> Being acknowledged -> Sense of value
```
This chain was once the **invisible anchor chain** of my ship, one end tied to my work, the other cast into the harbor of external recognition. When the main thread was reset, the fixed point in the harbor disappeared. The anchor chain clattered and sank into nothingness, and the ship began to drift aimlessly.

And when the overarching goal around which this chain itself revolved was reset to zero, the middle two links of this chain lost their guarantee. The meaning of responsibility was dissolved; doing or not doing made no difference. There were still many tasks, but each felt like a side quest. By inertia, I should still contribute, but the returns became extremely uncertain, so I tended to withdraw investment, and thus the economy stalled.

## Rebuilding

Just as in the real world, debt restructuring can be a good opportunity for an economy to recover. When the belief in my mind that "the external world will inevitably guarantee meaning for me" collapsed, pain was unavoidable. But closely following the pain came the opportunity for change, the possibility of truly taking charge of my own economy of desire, personally forging my own chain of meaning, thereby becoming a politically mature person.

Like this quote from Calvino:

> The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.

I now understand this quote like this: the inferno is the human world. When you open your eyes and find your entire life has lost an anchor, you discover the inferno, and this inferno is your life itself. At this point, you have two choices:

The first option: You acknowledge this inferno exists and surrender, then slide into nihilism: nothing a person does is worthwhile, start enjoying life while you can because it's short; or worse, simply become a cynical misanthrope; or deny the inferno exists, find a more solid external order for yourself, let this external order provide a strong guarantee for you, then issue commands to you, thus pretending this inferno doesn't exist.

Or, there is a second option: You acknowledge this inferno exists, but do not surrender. With a mature attitude, using that order mechanism that previously drove you forward, while recognizing it is man-made, revisable, and requires bearing consequences, create a new order, **load the aforementioned chain of meaning and economic system into it**, and then act.

The second option is almost the course of action I mentioned earlier. But what was missing in the previous thinking was a new chain of meaning that could carry the economic cycle of desire, one that could be patched, accumulated, and adjusted with my own subject's participation. One could say, I expected a correct outcome but didn't know how to reach it at the time.

Moreover, the previous "absolute course of action" sounded very intimidating; it seemed to demand a thorough transformation. Now it seems this posture itself isn't problematic, but there is some inversion within it: the goal shifted from **pursuing a guideline derived from metaphysical contemplation that descends into daily life and guides it** (which can be incomplete, and necessarily cannot be complete) to **pursuing a closed, complete symbolic order to be free from uncertainty**. The difference is that if you pursue completeness, this process will never end, so thinking becomes a means of procrastination, falling into the eternal oscillating thought I previously criticized.

My solution is: I choose a desired future, make a promise to myself, and bear its cost; the Other can only be a witness/collaborator, not guaranteeing an absolute.

### Summary

Combining all the key concerns of this article, specifically:

Recognize that the promised land—that is, a stable life, an anchor for thought, or the stability guaranteed by grand external narratives and large-scale orders—does not exist. In other words: external orders are not self-consistent, nor will they forever guarantee meaning for me.

At this point, you can consider yourself "dead": your position in the symbolic order is dead—old identity, old titles, old meanings, the old "who I am" has collapsed (expelled, canceled, negated by yourself). This process is usually accompanied by fear and anxiety.

But, do not retreat into old fantasies, do not seek a new absolute and new guarantee, do not stagnate, and do not use some self-destructive action to end everything.

What to do is: take risks yourself, calculate risks yourself, thereby plan a course of action, faithfully execute its principles. The person is still acting; the difference is bearing the cost oneself. Action itself is meaning.

It's like your ship has set sail, and suddenly you realize the ship isn't as perfect as the pre-departure inspection report described. You discover some flaws—sudden weather changes, some engine trouble. What should be done is still to find ways to adjust operations to move towards the既定 goal, while being prepared for death. At this point, panicking, becoming numb and doing nothing, or despairingly seeking death directly are all wrong.

Therefore, a truly commendable solution can be a bit rough. It should give clear answers to problems already understood, make arbitrary cuts on some issues not yet clear. At the detail and implementation level, it can be easily overturned and revised, but it will never waver on issues already clarified. But this solution must be able to adapt to local conditions and changing times to answer most questions. Its overhaul is not hitting a wall and turning back, but constantly encountering the friction of reality, realizing some things might be wrong, then correcting direction through iteration.

I like a line from "The 'Mary Gloster'":
> They copied all they could follow, but they couldn't copy my mind,  
> And I left 'em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind.

This line seems to say: others can copy what you do, but they can't copy how you think, how you reignite yourself.  
Continue as a ship, keep sailing, keep thinking, keep acting.
