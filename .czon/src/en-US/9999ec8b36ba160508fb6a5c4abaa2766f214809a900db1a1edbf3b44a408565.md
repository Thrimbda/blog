"summary": "This article uses the play 'Copenhagen' as a starting point to explore the historical mystery of the 1941 meeting between Heisenberg and Bohr in Copenhagen. It argues that, compared to the historical truth itself, the uncertainty of human motivation in the superposition of multiple identities holds greater research value. Through the reenactment of the three protagonists in the afterlife, the play deeply discusses issues such as ethics, morality, and human nature, transforming a complex historical event into an exquisite quantum experiment on humanity. Combining personal viewing experiences, the author emphasizes that great literary works, like poetry, use ambiguous imagery to reach the soul, offering different revelations to each individual, thereby enriching the depth and intensity of life."

## The Mystery of Copenhagen

_History may become increasingly elusive as more historical materials emerge, but we should focus on the invariants within human nature beneath the surface._

In 1941, German scientist Werner Heisenberg traveled to Copenhagen, Denmark, which was then occupied by Germany, to visit his former teacher Niels Bohr. However, this reunion after four years ended quite unpleasantly, abruptly concluding their nearly two-decade-long deep friendship and, perhaps, forever altering the fate of the world.

This is the famous "Mystery of the Copenhagen Meeting."

For decades, the truth about this event has been hotly debated. After the declassification of relevant archives post-Cold War and the release of more firsthand materials from Heisenberg, Bohr, and scientists from various countries, it has become clearer what roughly transpired during this meeting and what Heisenberg said to Bohr that caused Bohr’s fury and led to their permanent estrangement.

> "The conversation took place during an evening walk. I knew Bohr was under surveillance by German authorities, so I tried to conduct the conversation in a way that wouldn’t endanger myself. The conversation likely began with my question: **'Is it right for physicists to work on uranium fission during wartime?'** because progress in this field could lead to severe consequences for the war.
> Bohr immediately understood the meaning of the question and looked somewhat frightened. I recall him asking in return: 'Do you really think uranium fission can be used to make weapons?' I probably replied: 'In principle, it’s possible, but it requires immense technical effort. We can only hope it won’t be achieved during this war.'
> Bohr was shocked by my answer, clearly thinking I was conveying a message that Germany had made significant progress in developing atomic weapons. Although I later tried to correct this misunderstanding, I likely didn’t fully regain Bohr’s trust, especially since I spoke cautiously (which was absolutely my mistake) because I feared certain words might later be used against me. I was very dissatisfied with the outcome of this conversation."

> "I am particularly thinking of our conversation at the institute. During that conversation, the topic of 'war' came up, and I remember every word we said clearly.
> You began by saying you were convinced that if the war lasted long enough, it would be decided by atomic weapons, which left a deep impression on me. At the time, I knew nothing about the preparations underway in America. Just as I was somewhat skeptical, you added that I should understand one thing: you had spent almost all your time thinking about this problem in recent years and had no doubt it could be solved.
> Therefore, I cannot understand at all your later suggestion that you had hinted to me that German physicists would do everything possible to prevent the application of atomic technology. During this brief exchange, I was very cautious and thought a great deal."

Historians of natural science generally agree that the outcome of this conversation likely had a profound impact on the direction of atomic bomb development and deployment during World War II, the nuclear threats facing the world today, and the future development of science and human survival.

However, the declassification of historical materials did not resolve the core mystery: **Why** did Heisenberg go to Copenhagen? What was his **motivation**?

In my view, compared to the uncertain historical truth, the uncertainty of human behavior and motivation arising from the superposition of multiple identities holds greater research value. After all, history is a mirror. What we, as observers and the ones reflected in the mirror, can see and feel, how we construct our understanding of the real world, and how we use this understanding to interact with reality—these are the most exquisite and fascinating values this mirror offers us.

## 'Copenhagen' as a Play

_A profound discussion of the antinomies arising from the complexity of human nature and the limitations of the human mind._

To explore the chaotic uncertainty deep within human nature—the intricate and complex **motivations** of humanity—the play 'Copenhagen' features its three protagonists: Heisenberg, Bohr, and Bohr’s wife, Margrethe, appearing on stage as souls in a void. Driven by their obsession with the truth of this mystery, they reenact the meeting in the afterlife, unraveling the layers of complexity and contradiction in their superimposed identities and the uncertainty of human nature.

![theme](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/06/18/theme.jpg)

Why are "motivations" complex?

Because the real world is complex, filled with an overwhelming amount of information, and participants interact within a collective unconscious. History is complex, evolving amidst countless contradictions, blending chance and necessity. We cannot adopt a mechanistic materialist approach to dissect history, the people who constitute it, the environments that shaped them, their decisions and thoughts, and their relationships, hoping to analyze them separately and derive any meaningful answers.

Structure itself contains vast amounts of information. When the parts of a whole organically combine, countless unexpected new phenomena emerge.

Fortunately, humans are naturally fascinated by complexity and information beyond our processing capacity. Using the complexity of reality as raw material, 'Copenhagen' constructs its unique stage. By isolating and discussing various human-related issues from reality, 'Copenhagen' conducts an exquisite quantum experiment on human nature.

It highly condenses the most gripping and conflict-ridden parts of real history as its solid foundation:

First, war—the most devastating war in human history divides the three protagonists into opposing camps. Then, knowledge plays a role—the grand theoretical edifice has just been built, and the discovery of nuclear fission makes the development of nuclear weapons possible, raising suffocating moral challenges. Finally, human connections tie everything together—father and son, teacher and disciple—placing the relationship between Heisenberg and Bohr, at the center of the storm, within this framework to construct its most simple yet magnificent stage.

On this grand and solid foundation, the three vivid protagonists take the stage. With extreme care, their lives, values, achievements, and emotions are restored in the work. With the experimental conditions in place, the most crucial energy element is added—Heisenberg’s mysterious motivation for going to Copenhagen initiates this breathtaking experiment. Maintaining a scientific attitude, the experiment allows contradictions to develop freely and participants to collide violently, producing dazzling sparks. Through dialogues that are casual, everyday, intense, or gentle, the play deeply discusses topics such as ethics, morality, human nature, and fate, ultimately presenting the audience with an unparalleled masterpiece overflowing with information.

## The Quantum Laws in the Depths of Human Nature

_As the old saying goes, "There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people’s eyes."_

The value of great literary works does not lie in stating facts or providing specific solutions to problems. In my view, their significance lies in using poetic, ambiguous imagery to reach the human soul, offering revelations. These revelations, like a mirror, allow each person to observe different things—whether discussions of ethics and morality, critiques of reality, inquiries into human nature, or emotional resonance, evoking smiles, trembling tears, fear, anxiety, anger, warmth, fascination... Like an infinite source of energy, they add color and depth to our lives.

In the summer of 2018, I was interning at a company in Wudaokou, fresh out of university like a blank sheet of paper. Dragged by a fellow intern to Peking University to watch the graduate performance of 'Copenhagen,' this play has since resonated in my mind like a chain reaction, growing increasingly intense as it interacts with real-life experiences.

For me, the poetic revelation began with the following lines:

While recalling the establishment of the "Copenhagen Interpretation," Bohr says to Heisenberg:

---

> **Bohr** It works, yes. But it’s more important than that. Because you see what we did in those three years, Heisenberg? Not to exaggerate, but we turned the world inside out! Yes, listen, now it comes, now it comes .… We put man back at the centre of the universe. Throughout history we keep finding ourselves displaced. We keep exiling ourselves to the periphery of things. First we turn ourselves into a mere adjunct of God’s unknowable purposes, tiny figures kneeling in the great cathedral of creation. And no sooner have we recovered ourselves in the Renaissance, no sooner has man become, as Protagoras proclaimed him, the measure of all things, than we’re pushed aside again by the products of our own reasoning! We’re dwarfed again as physicists build the great new cathedrals for us to wonder at—the laws of classical mechanics that predate us from the beginning of eternity, that will survive us to eternity’s end, that exist whether we exist or not. Until we come to the beginning of the twentieth century, and we’re suddenly forced to rise from our knees again.
>
> **Heisenberg** It starts with Einstein.
>
> **Bohr** It starts with Einstein. He shows that measurement—measurement, on which the whole possibility of science depends—measurement is not an impersonal event that occurs with impartial universality. It’s a human act, carried out from a specific point of view in time and space, from the one particular viewpoint of a possible observer. Then, here in Copenhagen in those three years in the mid-twenties we discover that there is no precisely determinable objective universe. That the universe exists only as a series of approximations. Only within the limits determined by our relationship with it. Only through the understanding lodged inside the human head.

Are we the masters of all things?

> If people measure themselves by strictly discernible quantities... we will need a novel quantum ethics.

The chaos and complexity within us, as masters, mean we do not always understand each other. Even we ourselves are sometimes unknowable, so we are always searching, trying to unravel the mysteries left in the past.

> Our lives end while we are still searching.

The world will not end with humanity.

> Everything was spared, very likely, because of that brief moment in Copenhagen, that event that can never be located or defined, the ultimate core of the inherent uncertainty of all things.

## Afterword

Like many poems I love, I devoured this play whole. Then, at certain moments in life, it always sparks into my mind bit by bit. I begin to savor, chew, and ponder it, absorbing some wisdom or at least gaining a bit of pleasure.

But is that enough?

For years, I’ve had the urge to write this article. But one day in 2019, after writing the title and staring blankly at the computer for hours, I almost trembled and gave up. What depth, wisdom, and breadth must one possess to write a review of this play without humiliating oneself? I was too young, lacking all of these—I wasn’t worthy of writing it.

But is retreating with such an attitude acceptable? Then, continuing to recklessly and indiscriminately consume all kinds of good things without seeking understanding, wasting treasures, until the age of 90, hoping for a sudden enlightenment to turn decay into magic?

No, that is a waste of life. It makes everything taste too bland, and a life too bland is not worth living.

> Verse, Fame, and Beauty are intense indeed.
> But Death's intenser -- Death is Life's high meed.

So, before death, strive to live as intensely as possible. But what is "intense"?

It is the rich aroma of life;
It is the brilliance of human nature;
Perhaps it is the Olympic spirit—challenging oneself and pushing limits;
It is making oneself a bridge to the path of the Übermensch;
It is the tree on the mountain, rooted in the darkest depths, growing toward the highest sky, and waiting for the thunder.

Thus, we welcome the highest reward of our lives, and death becomes intense.

Life is toil; death is rest. Only an intense life deserves an even more intense death.

Today, compared to the depth, wisdom, and breadth needed to write that **perfect** review, I am still impoverished, young, and shallow. But perhaps what matters is not "perfection" but the determination to extract every last drop. Perhaps it is through each extraction that one gains depth, wisdom, and breadth. Perhaps only in this way does life become more intense.
