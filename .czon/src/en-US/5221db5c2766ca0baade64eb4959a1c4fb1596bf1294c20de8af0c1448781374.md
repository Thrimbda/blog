"title": "A Few Words After Setting Up the Blog"
"summary": "This article documents the author's complete process of building a personal blog over two days after the 2017 Lunar New Year. Initially dissatisfied with the limitations of platforms like Jianshu, the author was inspired by a friend's blog and decided to build their own. They first manually deployed a blog using the Hexo framework and the NexT theme to GitHub Pages. Seeking greater convenience, they then explored using Travis CI for automatic building and deployment, ultimately succeeding by following a friend's tutorial. In conclusion, the author reflects on their learning habits through the experience of building the blog, advocating for perseverance as a fresh start for the new year."

It took me two days to set up my own blog, and now I’m bursting with thoughts, wanting to share three points.

## The Reason Behind It

After returning home on January 25th, I joyfully celebrated the Lunar New Year.

I have this flaw: I absolutely cannot study when I’m home on vacation. Back in high school, homework would occasionally keep me in check on weekends, but now I’m completely unrestrained. However, I couldn’t just let myself mess around at home every day. While habits are hard to change, people are adaptable. So, as soon as the New Year festivities were mostly over after the eighth day of the lunar month, I escaped my own clutches and returned to school. The lab has one advantage: no matter how comfortable the environment, I can muster the willpower not to switch to Windows to play games.

Back at school, after tweaking my half-dead website, I started thinking about the personal blog I’d been eyeing for a long time. Previously, because [Jianshu](http://www.jianshu.com/) supported markdown, I eagerly registered. After writing a couple of casual essays, I still felt there were too many restrictions and not enough freedom—call it nitpicking if you will. Seeing [Azheng’s blog](https://zccz14.com/) thriving, I immediately felt I needed to learn a thing or two.

## Getting Hands-On

Actually, Azheng had written a tutorial: [*Elegantly Using Hexo*](https://zccz14.com/2016/12/30/%E4%BC%98%E9%9B%85%E5%9C%B0%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8Hexo/). It’s very detailed, and following it step-by-step would have made the setup quick. But I was blind to it at first, so I dove in with full enthusiasm to figure things out on my own.

For the same reason, I decided not to write another tutorial. Instead, I’ll simply record my **journey of thoughts**, adding links where appropriate.

First, I noticed the Hexo blog framework. After a night of research, I set up a Hexo blog, installed the NexT theme, configured it myself, deployed it to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and set up domain resolution.

At this point, the blog was up and running, and I could have stopped here. But I still felt that manually generating and publishing updates for this static blog was a bit cumbersome. I wanted to see if there was a way to make this already convenient solution even more convenient—basically, I was lazy, lazy as hell. ~~But then again, isn’t the world able to progress because lazy people want to make their laziness more comfortable?~~

Then I discovered a pinned blog post by the founder of NexT (the theme), discussing whether Travis CI’s automatic build and continuous integration—a service that benefits humanity—could be used to automatically update the blog. But since I had to wake up early the next morning, I first migrated two articles from Jianshu to fill this beautiful vase and went to bed early.

Yesterday, I played all day and didn’t touch this. Today, back in the lab, I continued tinkering. Suddenly, I found Azheng’s tutorial on using Travis for automatic builds. It was on a whole other level, truly impressive:

> - Quick Deployment  
>   Leveraging Git’s features, keep version-controlled files small and numerous, containing only source code.
> - Automatic Deployment  
>   No need to manually use `hexo deploy` for deployment. Just push the source code to GitHub, and it deploys automatically.
> - No Installation Required  
>   You can write/publish blog posts even without a node.js environment, Hexo CLI tools, or even Git.

At this point, I was satisfied with setting up my blog.

## Bursting with Thoughts

Finally, as the concluding remarks for this sacrificial post to inaugurate the blog, I want to use this silly-sounding phrase I made up an hour ago as the title for this section, expressing the little insights I’ve gained.

New year, new beginnings! This is also the first post after the Lunar New Year.

Earlier, I crammed for three days to learn linear algebra from scratch for an exam. Every day, I marveled: if only I could work this hard every day in my daily life. As the saying goes, “A steed’s single leap cannot cover ten paces; a nag’s ten-day journey succeeds through perseverance.” This is probably an example, and I’m no steed anyway.

In fact, this should be my lifelong goal: perseverance.

To have hopes in your heart and walk steadily toward them.
