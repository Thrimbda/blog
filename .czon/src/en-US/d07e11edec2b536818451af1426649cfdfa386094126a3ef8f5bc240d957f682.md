Five hours have passed since the defense ended, and I feel as if a layer of skin has been peeled off, leaving me ashamed and embarrassed. Silently riding my bicycle, I blend into the sycamore-lined path. Fortunately, there are only strangers around, giving me a moment to catch my breath.

Avoidance.

This is indeed the thought I haven’t yet been able to articulate into words. I fear any possibility of deceiving myself.

So I need to think: Where exactly did things go wrong?

## The Defense

We included Light, the online judging platform we’ve been working on and which I’ve been fascinated by, in our application for the major innovation project. To gain support, or perhaps to put some pressure on ourselves, we decided to do this. Ah Zheng asked me to be the lead for this project, responsible for handling all related matters. After hastily submitting the application, I learned that the defense was scheduled for today at noon, and I had two days to prepare.

And so, at noon today, I suffered a crushing failure. The judges gave me the impression that they had no idea what I was talking about, thinking I was daydreaming, fabricating ideas out of thin air, and trying to pitch a nonsensical, imaginary project to secure funding.

Where did things go wrong?

### External Factors

A total of eight groups presented their major innovation projects today, and I was the last one. The judges were indeed not professional, and some even seemed to be flaunting their seniority. But can I blame them?

No. If our product is meant for the general public, it must be simple enough, easy to understand and use. Therefore, if even judges in the relevant field couldn’t digest and comprehend it, then it must be a poorly defined product.

So, let’s think further: Where did things go wrong?

### Surface-Level Issues

There was clearly something wrong with my PowerPoint presentation. During the Q&A session after the defense, the judges spent half their time pointing out issues with the slides. This problem was likely the most obvious and frustrating.

This was caused by a belief I’ve held more firmly in recent defenses: that PowerPoint should outline key points, while the content should be delivered primarily through speech.

This in itself isn’t a problem, but this time, I fell into a pathological obsession: only titles, no body text, and even incomplete content.

Simplicity isn’t the issue; the problem is shoddiness.

No data, no charts, no examples—I lacked everything that could clarify the points and make the presentation clearer.

But was it just the PowerPoint that ruined the defense? I’m afraid it wasn’t that simple.

### Communication Skills

I am well aware of my weakness: severely inadequate communication skills. But do I truly understand this?

Even with my flawed PowerPoint, a proper delivery could have made the defense comprehensible.

My speech lacked coherence, my logic lacked connectivity, and my expression lacked completeness. On top of that, I stuttered, forgot my lines—all fatal flaws.

Thus, the surface-level PowerPoint issues exposed my shortcomings in communication.

But can these shortcomings be changed? I believe they can. However, despite knowing I had these weaknesses, I didn’t take appropriate measures to prevent them from being exposed—I could have.

What else?

### Understanding of the Project

I’ve had a similar defense experience during my training in Chengdu. That time, the PowerPoint wasn’t as exaggerated, and my delivery was much better. I believe the secret to that success was my role as the project manager, overseeing everything: I designed the entire system in detail, understood every aspect of the API server and why it was designed that way, and clearly knew what kind of system I was building, who it was for, and its potential for future development.

But this time was different. I don’t think I fully understood Ah Zheng’s vision for the entire system: the analysis of users’ potential needs, the definition of the system, and its future, especially its developmental prospects.

### The Root Cause

So, what was the root cause of the problem?

**Lack of genuine effort.**

If I had delved deeply into the project and developed my own profound understanding;

If I had rehearsed before the defense;

If my PowerPoint had contained more content;

The defense likely wouldn’t have been such a disaster.

**In short, I feel ashamed.**

Diligence can compensate for clumsiness, not tranquility leading to distant goals. I hope I can remember this.

## Reflections

After dinner, I took a walk around campus with my glasses and a bottle of soy milk. I discovered a small garden north of the library where I could think quietly.

There, I summarized why my defense had turned into a mess and pondered what makes a good product.

### A Thought Experiment

Newton once said he was just a child picking up shells by the sea of truth, while we are a species with an insatiable thirst for knowledge.

I believe there are two types of pioneers on the journey of exploration:

+ Creators of technology
+ Implementers of technology

The first type builds lofty foundations, worthy of remembrance and historical records, serving as the pride of their era and a beacon for future progress. The second type thinks deeply and thoroughly, connecting technology and humanity in a natural and harmonious way, truly realizing progress.

—Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction, while Edison and Tesla created the entire electrical age.

Thus, I define a good product as follows:

​	**It meets a basic human need, is convenient to use, and serves as a bridge between technology and humanity.**

### Returning to the Starting Point

I looked up at the towering sycamore trees. Everything has a structure.

How do we abstract, model, and analyze the intrinsic connections of things? How do we see the essence beneath surface-level phenomena?

Human society also has a structure. The depth of one’s perspective and their grasp of information and resources are ways to delineate this structure. If everyone is born equal, then education provides the ladder for structural change. However, this still cannot resolve the contradictions arising from information asymmetry. For example, those at the higher levels of this structure can only communicate with those at lower levels through media, analogous to a C/S architecture. Currently, there is no efficient way to match information seekers with providers (peer-to-peer).

**Perhaps Light can solve this kind of problem? This remains to be explored.**
