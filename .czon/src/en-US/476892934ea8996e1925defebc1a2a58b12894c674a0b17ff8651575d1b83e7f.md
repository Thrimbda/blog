"title": "'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot"
"summary": "This article documents the author's experiences and reflections after beginning a solo life as a \"Northern Drifter\" in Beijing. Through the initial pressures of an internship, the author recognizes these challenges as possessing a 'rich sense of life,' which accelerated adaptation to the new environment. The essay references 'Born in sorrow, die in happiness' and a metaphor by Calvino to emphasize the importance of maintaining vigilance and learning within daily life (or 'hell')—to seek out non-infernal elements, grant them space, and thus avoid living blindly or passively accepting the status quo. The author advocates cultivating clear self-awareness, consciously facing the risk of failure, living each day fully, and cites a friend's words to encourage seizing opportunities. Ultimately, the article concludes with a positive outlook, championing growth through self-imposed challenges and having no regrets about one's choices."

> 'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
> **but being too happy in thine happiness.**

I have finally begun the long-cherished solo living, embarking on a ~~greenhouse-style~~ "Northern Drifter" life.

## Prelude to the Northern Drift

People probably change their life trajectories inadvertently, often realizing it only long after the fact. What we can experience is the present moment, so let's set aside for now what the decision to take a Gap truly changed. But that night was truly liberating—not because of the drinks and food, but because of the silly English conversation with Vicious Master. It was a bit like sitting by a campfire on a cold night, cooking soup—even if you might freeze to death the next day, while warming yourself by the fire, you see the dazzling Milky Way, not the frozen wasteland.

I've always believed that the most sophisticated way to kill someone is to stand from their perspective and question why they didn't seize a good opportunity they should have grasped earlier. The key to this method is that the opportunity is irrevocably lost, and the more precious the lost opportunity, the more effective it is. After the person breaks down, you can shamelessly claim you did it for their own good.

But in the end, I didn't break down. As always, I treated it as a stepping stone on the journey.

Soon after, I started an internship. For the first two days, I was completely clueless about the work I was supposed to handle. I felt like an imposter, someone who knew nothing and had come just to cause trouble. In the new environment, I kept wondering why I was torturing myself—wouldn't it be better to just be a "salted fish" (i.e., someone content with mediocrity)? **But this pressure was beneficial; it carried a very rich sense of life.** So, I quickly adapted to the new environment.

### Vigilance and Learning

We often say **"Born in sorrow, die in happiness"** (生于忧患，死于安乐). Please note, this isn't a college entrance exam essay. I realized another quote I particularly like shares a similar essence:

> "The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant **vigilance and learning**: how to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space."

I adore this metaphor so much that sometimes my speech becomes obscure, using abstract yet simple symbols to express rich meanings. The benefit of this approach is that you can imbue these symbols with meaning from your own life, learning new insights from them. **Reviewing the old to understand the new** (温故而知新)?

What I want to tell myself through this quote is that without clear **self-awareness**, living blindly will make time pass quickly. When the world finally rushes toward you, you'll crash into a mountain and realize it's all too late, giving others the chance to "kill" you using the sophisticated method I mentioned. Or, life will pass smoothly, and you'll become "part of the inferno."

Therefore, acknowledge the risk of failure, understand its consequences, and then live each day consciously—vigilant and continuously learning. If all goes well, I'll probably ask myself at every stage why I'm tormenting myself, but in reality, the days will be fulfilling, and I'll have no regrets.

Just as a very optimistic friend of mine summarized his past year:

> "So sometimes you don't need to worry about the things that have not happened, just be yourself and hang in there, make sure that when the opportunity comes, you won't let it go!"

Let's do our best.
