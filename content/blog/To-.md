## To -

```
TIME’S sea hath been five years at its slow ebb,
  Long hours have to and fro let creep the sand,
Since I was tangled in thy beauty’s web,
  And snared by the ungloving of thine hand.

And yet I never look on midnight sky,
  But I behold thine eyes’ well memoried light;
I cannot look upon the rose’s dye,
  But to thy cheek my soul doth take its flight.

I cannot look on any budding flower,
  But my fond ear, in fancy at thy lips
And harkening for a love-sound, doth devour
  Its sweets in the wrong sense:—Thou dost eclipse

Every delight with sweet remembering,
And grief unto my darling joys dost bring.
```

### 小记

后来发现，这首`To - ["Time's sea"]`中最后两句

```
Every delight with sweet remembering,
And grief unto my darling joys dost bring.
```

和莎士比亚`sonnet CXIII`中

```
Even so, being full of your ne'er cloying sweetness,
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding.
```

有些韵律上的相似。难怪曾经看到济慈这首诗的脚注中提到 “在情绪构架的韵律处理上，在逐渐增强的乐感上，都极似莎士比亚十四行诗。”
