MapReduce was very successful. However, most systems built around acyclic graphs were not general-purpose. At this point, Spark emerged, **proposing a distributed computing framework that can support**:

through a distributed data structure called RDD.

RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) is a read-only data structure that can be reconstructed from its lineage in the DAG if lost.

Spark is implemented in Scala, which has the following characteristics:
- A language implemented on the JVM
- Supports functional programming
- Object-oriented

## Programming Model

### Introduction to RDD

RDDs can be created in four ways:

1. From a file system, e.g., HDFS
2. From a Scala collection
3. Transformed from an existing RDD (via operations like `flatMap`, `map`, `filter`, etc.)
4. By changing the persistence method of an existing RDD (RDDs are read-only; any modification logically creates a new RDD)

Additionally, RDDs are lazy and ephemeral data structures. Users can persist RDDs in two ways:

- Via `cache`: A cached RDD remains lazy but is no longer ephemeral, meaning it is stored after its first evaluation for reuse.
- Via `save`: Writing to a distributed file system.

Users need to make a trade-off between access speed and storage space.

### Parallel Operations

- `reduce` - Associative operation
- `collect`
- `foreach` - Side effect

## Examples

- Log statistics
- Logistic regression
- ALS (Alternating Least Squares)

With the characteristics of lazy and ephemeral, Spark behaves similarly to MapReduce. However, adding a caching step can significantly accelerate computations.

## Implementation

- (At the time the paper was written) Built on top of Mesos
- The core implementation lies in the RDD interface, fully leveraging Scala's object-oriented and functional features:
  - `getPartitions`
  - `getIterator(partition)`
  - `getPreferredLocations(partition)` - For locality considerations
- Tasks (closures) in Scala are Java Objects, so they can be serialized and sent. During implementation, a bug in Scala was even discovered.
- Interpreter integration was also implemented.
- At the time the paper was written, shuffle had not yet been implemented.

## Experimental Results

- Significantly outperforms Hadoop, up to 10x faster.
- Dataset size was small.

## Related Work

- Distributed Shared Memory
- MapReduce
- Scala is similar to DryadLINQ

## Thoughts

- This was still early-stage work; the authors were excited to share it. The 10x improvement over Hadoop was quite impressive.
- This article is relatively high-level.
- Functional, immutable, enabling lazy evaluation.
- Neither Hadoop nor Spark at that time could surpass MapReduce.
