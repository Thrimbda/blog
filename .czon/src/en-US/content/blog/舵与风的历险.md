"summary": "This article is the author's deep reflection on the stagnation experienced in mid-2025. Using a ship as a metaphor, the author compares reason to the rudder and sails, and desire to the wind or engine, describing the predicament of being trapped in the 'doldrums' due to the reset of the team's main narrative, which severed external feedback. The article analyzes the imbalance between two sources of motivation—duty-driven and interest-driven—and points out that over-reliance on external order (such as team recognition) can break the chain of meaning. Through metaphors from psychoanalysis and economic cycles, the author diagnoses the core problem as the bankruptcy of the 'desire economy.' Ultimately, the author proposes a reconstruction plan: abandon the pursuit of a perfect symbolic order, and instead, by taking risks, formulating actionable plans, and iteratively correcting them in reality, take charge of one's own chain of meaning."

> Consider this my 2025 summary?

If a person is like a ship, then reason is its rudder and sails, determining direction and adjusting posture; while desire is more like the engine, or the wind: it doesn't guarantee which port you'll reach, but it determines whether you can still leave the harbor.

Wind cannot push a ship without sails, nor can a ship move forward by rudder alone.

Since late May 2025, I have been caught in a certain symptom, leaving my ship becalmed in the vast ocean, unable to move. No direction, no wind. It wasn't a slowdown for a "rest," but a strange, complete stagnation—tasks piled up, schedules kept turning, yet I felt as if my propulsion had been removed. Even "getting started" became laborious, leading to a complete standstill.

This is my description and reflection on that state at the time. I didn't reach any conclusions then, only trying to understand what was wrong with me, attempting to analyze my own mind.

## The Symptom

From late May 2025, I was somewhat lost, sinking into a state of "unwillingness to do anything." The reason for this state wasn't clear to me at the time. Looking back later, I could only retroactively construct the cause from some clues. In other words, depending on the current situation, these explanations could be vastly different.

Thinking became abundant, action became scarce. I could deduce many possibilities, write many analyses, compare many "optimal solutions"; but actual decision-making and commitment became even rarer. During that time, I had many metaphysical conversations with CZ, who expressed considerable bewilderment and dissatisfaction, as did I.

### The Imbalance of Two Driving Forces

To explain all this, I need to divide the sources of motivation into two categories: one more driven by external order, and one more pulled by internal interest. For convenience, I'll call them **Duty-Driven** and **Interest-Driven**.

> Borrowing a bit of psychoanalytic language, they roughly correspond to two common subjective stances: one more reliant on "being driven by external order," the other more on "being pulled by internal interest." But I won't strictly correspond them here, only using them to illustrate the difference.

For me, duty-driven means: meaning lies outside the subject. I do things to complete an existing order, making it more stable and complete. Interest-driven is the opposite: meaning is more endowed by the subject. I do things to create a new order, to make the world change a bit because of my intervention.

I believe these two driving forces should occupy a person's time and energy in a balanced way. The scale tipping too far to either side causes trouble. Excessive duty leads to burnout, eventually looking back and not knowing what one was busy with; the most severe consequence is losing a sense of meaning. Excessive interest leads to isolation, being cut off from the external world without realizing it, ignoring many external signals while focusing only on one's inner world, ultimately still having to deal with the relationship with the external order.

The problem was: during that period, these two driving forces were imbalanced in me, and the imbalance was very subtle.

For the past few years, I had long been accustomed to playing a role in the team that was more logistical, more infrastructural: building, completing, maintaining, providing backup. Such work is very important, but it inherently has a structure: **it depends on a main narrative**. When the main narrative is clear, the meaning of logistics is lasting and stable—feature advancement, team operation, risk reduction, controllable progress, one link after another, with a clear path of return.

But when the team's main task was reset to an "initial state"—old goals zeroed out, old priorities invalidated—my accustomed duty circuit suddenly lost its anchor: there were still many tasks, but each seemed like a side quest; I could still do them, but doing or not doing them didn't seem to change the fact that the "main narrative was not yet established." Thus, the external order no longer gave me feedback, the meaning of duty-driven motivation was dissolved, and interest-driven motivation hadn't taken over yet. So the entire ship entered the doldrums.

I thought at the time it was because I "hadn't figured it out," but now I'm more willing to admit: it was a consequence of **having a single source of motivation and a feedback mechanism overly reliant on an external harbor**. My wind came from one place; when that place disappeared, the vast ocean immediately became a stagnant pond.

### Unfinished Thoughts

> This chapter contains my thoughts at the time. I originally expected a concrete action plan but got stuck on it.
#### Why Thinking is Needed

A temporary slowdown in pace isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as it can lead to some results in thinking, helping to re-establish order.

This thinking must be systematic, to distinguish fantasy from genuine thought. I describe the thinking process like this: a person, based on various favorable and unfavorable conditions in their current situation, arrives at a conclusion about how to act—an **action plan**. This action plan must withstand scrutiny from various angles to judge whether it is reasonable, whether it holds up. If reasonable, then action should follow naturally; otherwise, a new conclusion will replace the previous incomplete and immature one. This process can be repeated until reaching an **absolute**, unchanging state.

This action plan is the inevitable result of the subject bearing the weight of life. Scarcity produces desire, and desire drives the subject to constantly try to symbolize the real world. However, a person cannot integrate themselves into a "perfect" symbolic order and become static matter, because the world cannot be static. One can never definitively state what their symbolic essence is. Since the death of God (or since people finally realized God never existed), humans can no longer grasp their own essence (or rather, the essence that once existed was an illusion). Only the subject exists, needing to notice every moment that the real world has changed, accept and understand it, and then re-register it into the symbolic system—just like an oil film on flowing water constantly changing its hue, trying to completely cover the water's surface. This action plan points to a future. As this future pulls the subject towards itself, the subject is constantly reborn, not decaying, not dying.

#### Abandoning Thought?

We need to consider a possibility: **Is it possible for a person to abandon thought?**

First, complete abandonment means giving up on formulating any action plan. But from the moment of birth, a person can no longer return to the mythical state of desirelessness before birth. Scarcities from physiology to psychology drive a person to do something to fill these lacks. Therefore, completely abandoning thought is impossible.

#### Thinking Forever?

Is there a possibility that this thinking forever oscillates in a state of swaying?

Of course, there is such a possibility. Behind this recursive behavior of constantly overturning previous thoughts is the subject's refusal to finally specify an action plan, refusal to acknowledge the existence of a future. Then, time becomes meaningless to the subject. This cycle—it is essentially a cyclical escape, evading the responsibility of being an existent, finding enjoyment in this cycle. Admittedly, this enjoyment is quite attractive; otherwise, why would there be so many people addicted to scrolling through TikTok?
#### My Critique

Being lost is shameful because there are no people who live off the air. If a person is not being kept, then based on their own situation, they are first forced to act, otherwise they will starve.

## Looking Back

At that time, I left a critique and got stuck. The next chapter was supposed to be "Action Plan," describing a goal I could be loyal to after the deep thinking mentioned above, and using this goal to deduce how to act at every moment. But I ultimately didn't write it, at least didn't arrive at such an action plan at that time. So, after leaving that critique, this article was shelved. I believe the root cause wasn't that I lost reason, nor that there was something wrong with the performance of my ship itself. It was that I lost the wind, lost motivation.

I tried to anchor myself through absolute thinking, seeking a "perfect" action plan to end all uncertainty. But this precisely trapped me in the "enjoyment of thinking"—constantly deducing and overturning, replacing real choices with the oscillation of speculation. I only understood later that this itself was part of the symptom: when the external guarantee of meaning failed, I fantasized about replacing it by constructing a complete symbolic order through introspection. This was destined to be futile because **the endpoint of thinking is not a perfect answer, but the determination to take responsibility**.

I now believe that all philosophy must move towards practice. Zarathustra must descend the mountain; the person who leaves the cave must also return to the cave—not to repeat the enlightenment narrative, but because it is only in the friction of the human world that thought is realized.
Therefore, what I need to end is not thinking itself, but that oscillation that finds pleasure in overturning and safety in hesitation: it made me seem to be approaching truth, while actually avoiding commitment.
I want to adopt another posture in life: first implement a phased direction into action, then use the results of action to correct the direction; let reality be the judge, let contradictions drive progress, not let me spin in place.

And now I am already moving forward at full capacity and need to further optimize efficiency at the rational level, so I am picking up this previous article to complete it.

## Diagnosis

This is how I think about the problem: the wind or engine as motivation was the crux of my previous issue.

I realize that a person's motivation is very much like a **supply system needed for navigation**. We invest time, attention, and emotion like fresh water and fuel, expecting to get three things in return: meaning (**charts and celestial markers**), echo (**lighthouses or echoes from the shore**), and sensation (**the state of the ship itself**). When this balance of income and expenditure is disrupted... the **supply cycle** of my ship is interrupted.

For me, its essence is a Lacanian **desire economy** that can cycle, and this economy **went bankrupt** before, the chain of meaning broke.

For example, I once chatted with a friend who earned a year's salary by trading stocks. I said I don't think you really like money, because if that were the case, you should quit your job, or at least spend more effort on stocks, but he was still working hard.
So clearly, for him, his chain of meaning is not:
```
Stock trading -> Wealth -> Security -> Freedom -> Satisfaction
```

Analyzing carefully, there's much to ponder here: on one hand, making money from stocks doesn't mean stock trading can always create wealth, or wealth that guarantees a worry-free life. On the other hand, the freedom brought by money doesn't necessarily mean satisfaction; it's very possible that for him, being recognized by others, being acknowledged by society, brings satisfaction. I have no intention of psychoanalyzing him here, so I can stop.

Human motivation is often not driven by a certain "fact," but by a string of "narratives." One word leads to another, one explanation leads to another: success leads to recognition, recognition leads to value, value leads to security. Meaning connects like a chain backward. We think we are chasing a goal, but actually we are constantly moving backward on this chain. The chain makes life understandable, but when it loses a place to "pause temporarily," a person enters a state of interpretive overload: the more one thinks, the faster one overturns, but the harder it is to act.

But there's something even more subtle: what keeps this chain running is often not the goal itself, but that little bit of **ineffable inducement** behind the goal—a look of recognition, a stable position, a gap of "almost getting it." A person can change projects, cities, relationships; the surface things pursued will change, but that little inducement often reappears. Understanding it is not for self-blame, but to see clearly: what exactly is pulling me, where am I overdrawing, where do I need to rearrange my sources of feedback.

With this illustrative example, I can now diagnose: for my previous self, the chain of meaning was:
```
Logistical work -> System stability -> Smooth team operation -> Being acknowledged -> Sense of value
```
This chain was once the **invisible anchor chain** of my ship, one end tied to my work, the other cast into the harbor of external recognition. It made me willing to invest long hours because I believed the return path existed: as long as the system is stable, the team runs smoothly; as long as the team runs smoothly, I am needed and acknowledged; as long as I am acknowledged, I have a sense of value.

When the main narrative was reset, the fixed point in the harbor disappeared, and the anchor chain clattered into nothingness. Tasks were still plentiful, but the middle two links of the chain lost their guarantee: my continued investment did not necessarily lead to the visible result of "smooth team operation," let alone "being acknowledged." So, I began to withdraw investment; withdrawal made the system harder to advance; greater difficulty further weakened meaning; the cycle ultimately went bankrupt.

If I borrow a psychoanalytic formula:

> Desire = Demand - Need, it is a surplus.

For me, the "surplus" is not at the material level, but at the feedback level: what I need is not just completing tasks (need), nor just responding to demands (demand), but that little surplus of "being placed on this chain"—being acknowledged, being witnessed, being incorporated into a sustainable circuit of meaning. When this surplus disappears, motivation dries up.

This is not a moral problem, nor an intellectual problem, but the rupture of an economic cycle: I had previously handed over the issuance rights of my desire economy to the external order. Once the external order malfunctioned, I could only go bankrupt.
## Reconstruction

Just as in the real world, the bailout of an economy sometimes provides a good opportunity for debt restructuring and a fresh start. When the belief in my mind that "the external world will inevitably guarantee meaning for me" collapsed, pain was unavoidable. But closely following the pain came the opportunity for change, the possibility of truly taking charge of my own desire economy, forging my own chain of meaning, thereby becoming a politically mature person.

Like this sentence by Calvino:

> The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.

I now understand this sentence like this: hell is the human world. When you open your eyes and find that your entire life has lost an anchor, you discover hell, and this hell is your life itself. At this point, you have two choices:

The first option: You acknowledge the existence of this hell and surrender, then slide into nihilism: nothing a person does is worthwhile, start to believe life is short, enjoy it while you can; or worse, simply become a cynical misanthrope; or deny the existence of hell, find a more solid external order for yourself, let this external order provide a strong guarantee for you, then give you orders, thus pretending this hell doesn't exist.

Or there is a second option: You acknowledge the existence of this hell but do not surrender. With a mature attitude, using the order mechanism that previously drove you forward, while recognizing that it is man-made, revisable, and requires bearing consequences, create a new order, **load the aforementioned chain of meaning and economic system into it**, and then act.

The second option is almost the action plan I mentioned above, but what was missing in the previous thinking was a new chain of meaning that could carry the economic cycle of desire, one that could be repaired, accumulated, and adjusted with my own subjective participation. It could be said that I expected a correct result but didn't know how to reach it at the time.

The previously stuck "absolute action plan" was generally correct in direction but sounded very intimidating, seemingly requiring a thorough transformation. Now it seems that this posture itself is not problematic, but there is some inversion within it: the goal shifted from **pursuing a guideline derived from metaphysical contemplation that descends into daily life and guides it** (which can be incomplete, and necessarily cannot be complete) to **pursuing a closed, complete symbolic order to avoid uncertainty**. The difference is that if one pursues completeness, this process will never end, so thinking becomes a means of procrastination, falling into the eternal oscillating thought I previously criticized.

My current solution is that the key to reconstruction is not "finding a perfect answer," but adopting a simpler, more actionable posture:

**I choose a desired future, make a promise to myself, and bear its cost; the Other can only be a witness and collaborator, no longer the absolute guarantor.**

This sentence sounds like a slogan, but when implemented, it is very concrete: it means I must allow uncertainty to continue to exist, allow plans to go live at seventy percent, allow correction through action; it also means I have to pay for my own choices, not use "let me think more" to indefinitely postpone the cost.

After all, pessimists are right, optimists succeed.

### Summary

Combining all the key concerns of this article, specifically:

Recognize that the promised land—that is, a stable life, an anchor for thought, or the stability guaranteed by a grand external narrative—does not exist. In other words: the external order is not self-consistent, nor will it forever guarantee for me.

At this point, you can consider yourself "dead": your position in the symbolic order is dead—old identity, old title, old meaning, the old "who I am" has collapsed (expelled, canceled, negated by oneself). This process is usually accompanied by fear and anxiety.

However, do not retreat into old fantasies, do not seek a new absolute and a new guarantor, do not stagnate, and do not use some self-destructive action to end everything.

What to do is: take risks yourself, calculate risks yourself, thereby planning an action plan, faithfully execute its principles. The person is still acting; the difference is bearing the cost oneself. Action itself is meaning.

It's like your ship has set sail, and suddenly you realize the ship is not as perfect as described in the pre-departure inspection report. You discover some flaws, like sudden weather changes, like some engine trouble. What should be done is still to find ways to adjust operations to move towards the既定 goal, while being prepared for death. At this point, panicking and doing nothing, or despairingly seeking death directly, is wrong.

Therefore, a truly commendable solution can be a bit hasty. It should give clear answers to problems already understood, make arbitrary cuts to some still unclear issues. It can be easily overturned and revised at the detail and implementation level, but it will never waver on issues already clarified. However, this solution must be able to answer most questions according to local conditions and the times. Its overhaul is not hitting a wall and turning back, but constantly encountering the friction of reality, realizing some things might be wrong, then correcting direction through iteration.

I like a line from "The 'Mary Gloster'":
> They copied all they could follow, but they couldn't copy my mind,  
> And I left 'em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind.

This line seems to say: others can copy what you do, but they can't copy how you think, how you reignite yourself.  
Continue as a ship, keep sailing, keep thinking, keep acting.
