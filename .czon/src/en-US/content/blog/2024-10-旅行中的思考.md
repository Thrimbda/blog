"summary": "This article is a letter written by the author to a friend during a trip in October 2024, primarily discussing work, personal development, and future planning. The author first mentions a renewed passion for work and points out that the most urgent task currently is optimizing alerting and position adjustment methods to ensure risk control and operational convenience for the Fountain strategy. Next, the author reflects on the current state of the NTNL venture, believing that stable and sufficient cash flow is the foundation, with the future goal being to expand the asset scale tenfold, reaching the tens of millions level, to achieve a certain degree of freedom. To this end, it is necessary to deepen communication, enhance information acquisition, and continuously develop existing advantages. The author also explores the roots of anxiety and desire, attributing them to a lack of economic and cultural capital, and believes these can be transformed into driving forces in life. Finally, the author emphasizes the importance of active rest to better balance work and life."

To my friend Chen Zheng:
## Thoughts and Expectations Regarding Work in the Near Future

I feel that my passion for work has recovered quite a bit now. Let's spend some time later to adjust the Fountain strategy to the ideal position. Currently, the most pressing issue I see is the optimization of alerting and position adjustment methods.

1.  The lack of alerts makes us very insensitive to risk exposure, affecting our motivation and confidence in adjusting positions and leverage to an ideal state.
2.  The inconvenience of position adjustment methods makes it a troublesome and undesirable task for us. Imagine if adjusting positions were a very simple thing.

In DevOps, there is a concept called DayN. Day0 refers to software design and planning, Day1 to implementation and deployment, and Day2 to ongoing maintenance and iteration. Applied to the Fountain strategy, we have clearly entered the Day2 phase, which, in my view, is a boring and prolonged stage. However, people, including myself, often easily overlook its importance and become numb over time.

However, the recent vacation gave me some time to think and rest. Upon reflection, perfecting the Fountain strategy should be our most serious and necessary task. After ensuring the existence of risk control and the convenience of operations for Fountain, we can free up our hands to explore things like Meme, which expand the boundaries of our business.

## An Overall Reflection on Our Current State and Future

My expectation for the future (similar to our expectations in March but with subtle differences, and similar to my thoughts in May with some development) is that, relying on the stable operation of the Fountain strategy, we can obtain a continuous cash flow from it to support the expansion of other future ventures.

My assessment of our situation is as follows: the most critical need is stable and sufficient cash flow—the most basic requirement for maintaining the reproduction of our standard of living.

Next is our own development to a higher level. My idea of this higher level is: expanding the assets we can control tenfold, reaching the tens of millions level—to achieve a certain degree of freedom. To accomplish this step, we need to further develop the NTNL venture. In the thoughts I sent you in May, I outlined several paths we have taken or considered for developing our venture, discussing how to allocate our energy as the most important aspect. Looking back today, five months later, we have completed a shift in posture, from confusion to confidence: we have entered the Web3 field, are operating our fund with a more prudent and mature attitude, and have explored some further ways to make money based on Yuan as a product. I believe these three points are our favorable conditions. Embarking on the journey is more important than obtaining the scriptures; it can be said that we have completed the important starting point.

How to further develop the NTNL venture? In my view, we need to do two things:

1.  Deepen communication, enhance information acquisition, discover inspiration, and avoid working behind closed doors.
2.  Patiently and continuously grasp and develop our existing favorable conditions (such as the three mentioned above).

The second point is a matter of perception and attitude, which can be addressed by adjusting our attitude. The first point is necessary but something we currently lack.

For example, the acquisition of these existing favorable conditions came from the pitfalls and coincidences of the past two years. We both feel that such favorable turns come too slowly. What is the reason? "Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous." Our past practices did not strike a balance between these two; we absorbed too little new knowledge, and in comparison, engaged in too much stubborn, narrow-minded thinking. Additionally, there was a lot of numbness (at least on my part).

In September, we had a discussion where you suggested that work should follow its natural course, not forcing oneself to work, and that happily wasting time is better than working painfully. I agree with this statement, but at the time, I felt something else was missing. During that day's discussion, I didn't accurately grasp what it was, leading you to misunderstand that I needed some pressure from you, similar to a challenge, which was not the case. Now I would like to add: besides the instrumental rationality of work attitude and methods in daily life that you mentioned, we need value rationality to guide our direction. This value rationality is to further develop the NTNL venture, to the point of expanding our asset scale, and then further develop a mission-driven venture. Starting from such value rationality, we certainly need to balance our daily state, avoid excessive anxiety and pain, and also maintain some pressure and desire that drive us to work.

## Some Other Casual Talk

This trip has been a great opportunity for me to think and clear my mind. I just talked about anxiety. I don't know why I couldn't grasp it well before to describe it in words. Actually, the source of my anxiety is simple and can be attributed to anxiety about insufficient capital. Anxiety and desire are two sides of the same coin:

1.  Anxiety and desire regarding economic capital: Specifically, anxiety about the potential decline of one's social class and anxiety about insufficient confidence in moving to a higher level.
2.  Anxiety and desire regarding cultural capital: Desire for general social recognition and desire to know more.

Essentially, it is a longing for a certain kind of "freedom": the freedom to buy things and the freedom to experience the existence of life.

These anxieties and desires can actually become the fuel that constitutes the driving force of my life. Looking at it today, it's not that I am too anxious in daily life, but that I just needed a vacation to think and rest (laughs). In the future, I should rest more actively. How can one work well without resting well?
