"title": "I Finally Thought of the Answer, But Wait... What Was the Question?"
"summary": "This article documents the author's positive experience of accidentally sitting in the front row and attending lectures after a long period of not paying attention in class. It mentions key points emphasized by the instructors in the courses 'Software System Analysis and Design' and 'Software Testing and Evaluation,' such as the concept of a system, the importance of system design, the significance of requirements, and the necessity of signing contracts for projects. The author connects these points with personal experience, viewing this as a process of 'closing the barn door after the horse has bolted' in learning. However, the article ends humorously, stating that the original question intended for discussion was forgotten, embodying the common phenomenon described in the title of 'thinking of the answer but forgetting the question.'"

The title describes a phenomenon that sounds a bit neurotic but is actually quite common—at least for me, ~~and surely for you too.~~

This post was inspired by a moment of deep engagement during today's class. It was probably the most comfortable day of lectures I've had in about a year.

## About Attending Class

I haven’t paid attention in class for over a year now. The reasons: going to bed too late, feeling too drowsy during lectures, and eventually giving up entirely. But today, on a whim, I decided to sit in the front row and listen. Surprisingly, it felt great.

## Reflections

I’m not sure if it’s because I’ve accumulated a bit of experience lately or for some other reason, but I found that both instructors in *Software System Analysis and Design* and *Software Testing and Evaluation* mentioned several points I strongly agree with. It feels like learning the hard way and then rushing back to fix things.

+ The concept of a system
+ The importance of system design
+ The importance of requirements
+ Always sign a contract for projects!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Alright, I don’t want to write anymore because I’ve forgotten the question I wanted to discuss.

How sad.
