# Review of 'Escape from the 21st Century'

> Spoiler warning (feels necessary to mention this to avoid upsetting friends who haven't seen it)

I laughed a lot at the beginning, especially during the part with the busy older sister, but the further it went, the more I felt its tragic core. Young people always have boundless hopes for the future, fantasizing about countless unexpected joys of growing up: getting taller, living independently, supporting themselves, having a career, finding someone to love and seriously building a life together, and embarking on all the wonderful adventures that were out of reach in youth due to lack of money or time.

So, at first, after entering their 38-year-old bodies, the three teenagers are thrilled, believing their dreams have come true. But within seconds, things start to feel off. It turns out the future isn't necessarily as wonderful as they imagined in their youth. Endless money comes with blood, sweat, and danger. The hard-earned results of a near-death experience driven by a sense of justice are claimed by a superior. While their appearance is transformed, and they live with the person they admired in their youth, they are told they are actually unhappy.

What saddens me most is that the 18-year-old Chengyong actually starts to play the role of his 38-year-old self, taking on the "work" that is dirty and burdensome to him. That's just too cruel for a teenager. For us in reality, if there is a gradual process of disillusionment with our future hopes over time, it at least accumulates day by day, the result of being slowly pushed forward by the passage of time. It's not like suddenly snatching away a young person's dreams and forcing them to accept a dark reality.

Fortunately, they can still return to 1999, brawling in the classroom, gathering at the boss's house to brainstorm solutions, not having to face the helplessness of being 38 every moment.

This resonates deeply with me. During my final semester of senior year, when I interned in another city, I could still return to my familiar campus on statutory holidays or when important events occurred. I consciously savored my last moments of campus life, consciously cherished the final times with my roommates, friends, and the campus itself. In those moments, I strengthened my resolve, slowly and properly saying goodbye. Only then could I gradually adapt to this role change, accept living in an intricate cage I voluntarily entered, accept that I no longer had the time or mindset to spend an entire week immersed in, say, The Witcher 3, and to live independently in another city.

I now think the phrase "existence precedes essence" means this: by opening one's heart to reality, experiencing various things wholeheartedly, and allowing oneself to be shaped by them—things that often don't go as desired (sometimes exceeding expectations, sometimes falling short, which I think has its good and bad sides)—that is the real world's impact on the human spirit, challenging one's symbolic system, generating desire and love, and finally settling within a person to become their essence. The process from 18 to 38 is perhaps about spending time existing, forming an essence, while constantly pruning the dreams of youth, yet still growing, living, and becoming enriched.

But perhaps because I'm exactly halfway between 18 and 38, I feel both clear and confused. The film gently uses violence and exercise to shatter a distorted future. We who live in reality cannot force ourselves to drink a bottle of toxins to commit to the pursuit of physical fitness—a goal that can be achieved if sought. Yet, we haven't completely lost everything we cherished in our youth. We can, along with the film, open our shells and immerse ourselves in the tenderness represented by everything Liu Lianzhi loves.
