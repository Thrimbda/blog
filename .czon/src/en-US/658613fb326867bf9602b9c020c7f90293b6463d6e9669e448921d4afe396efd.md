## (一) That Long-Haired Young Guy

> A few days ago, I went to visit ZL far away for ten days. We chatted late into the night about many things that have happened over the years, so I'll just write as my thoughts flow.
>
> Also, this was originally four short essays I wrote in a series, now compiled into one.

On November 14, 2019, at noon, I had just gotten my company lunch box and opened Hearthstone, ready to play Battlegrounds while eating as usual. Suddenly, I jolted, remembering what my boss, far away, had asked me to do yesterday: welcome the third member of our team, also the first intern.

"Oh no, no, no, no, I completely forgot!" I immediately closed Hearthstone, put the lunch box on the table, and walked to the door of the small office area next door, curious about what this guy would be like.

I nervously peeked inside and soon met a pair of youthful eyes. Then, his shoulder-length hair startled me. Suppressing my expression, I planned to walk in confidently to introduce myself to ZL. He clearly guessed what I was thinking; beneath that youthful gaze emerged a sunny smile, instantly dissolving the awkwardness.

There's a very authentic Shaanxi noodle shop opposite Tsinghua University. We ended up having lunch there. The second shocking fact about ZL: his appetite was about three times that of mine, despite his slender frame.

On the way there and back, during our intermittent chatting, ZL, who had just graduated from the neighboring Forestry University, mentioned he planned to take the TOEFL and go abroad for graduate studies.

ZL was an incredibly emotionally rich young man. Fresh out of university, he was curious about everything, always ready to be inspired by anything. He was smart and pure, and didn't bind himself to any specific moral code—the kind of friend you'd be willing to discuss your xp with. To put it this way: Denji is ZL's most accurate anime avatar.

My time in Beijing was also coming to an end with some decisions. Three days later (exactly three days before today five years ago), ZL and I boarded a high-speed train to Suzhou, completely leaving Beijing and saying goodbye to our past lives. The gears of fate turned; the pendulum of time swung. And so began a legendary friendship.

## (二) Happy Days and Farewell

"Hey, ZL, we're on a business trip in Suzhou right now. If we don't stay in a hotel, the monthly business trip allowance can completely cover the rent. Then the leftover rent money can be used to go all out on decorating!"

"Holy shit, you're right!"

(Unfortunately, the business trip allowance ended a month after saying this.)

Life in Suzhou was like being back in university. We were in the High-Speed Rail New Town in the far north of Suzhou, surrounded by nothing. By 9 PM every night, the streets were eerily quiet, hardly a soul in sight.
There were very few rental options near the company. Most people chose the same apartment building, a ten-minute walk from the office—this was the "Momenta University dormitory."

ZL and I started trying to build a life. For example, I truly learned how to cook. ZL also bought quite a few things. Even the outbreak of the pandemic didn't affect this; instead, it brought us closer to other colleagues. That's also when we became good friends with playground. Soon, we found ourselves often playing Super Smash Bros. together at playground's place downstairs.

That's why my memories of the MMT days always feel happy and warm.

ZL's girlfriend of four years was studying in Canada at the time (also a major reason ZL wanted to study abroad). Before the pandemic outbreak, he went to reunite with her and brought back a bottle of ice wine for me. Over the next five years, I moved a total of six times. That bottle was one of the very few things I always kept with me. At first, I just felt the right moment to open it hadn't come. Later, it became deliberate—no matter where I was, it was always lying in my fridge.

By the autumn of 2021, ZL set off to begin his studies.

- The photo includes a certain @playground who prefers not to show their face.
- ZL said it's fine to post his photos.
- This is that bottle of ice wine.

## (三) Wanna Go Cycling Around Qinghai Lake?

In the summer of 2021, a few weeks before ZL left for school, we planned a cycling trip around Qinghai Lake. The itinerary was six days and five nights, with the actual cycling around the lake taking four full days: a total of 360 kilometers, averaging 90 km per day. I lost 5 pounds in the week after returning, even with my diet back to normal.

I had wanted to do another crazy travel plan like this ever since one I did in the summer before starting university in 2014. Over the years, I had怂恿 and called on every friend around me. ZL was the only one who showed great interest and responded enthusiastically.

We started from a bike rental shop in Haiyan County (I brought my own bike, ZL rented a touring bike) and cycled clockwise around the lake.

The sky met the water in a single line, under a vast clear sky. As far as the eye could see, there was only the road stretching to the horizon. Under the expansive blue sky was an even bluer sea, beside which were vast fields of rapeseed flowers. On the road next to the fields, there were only the two of us.
For four days, the world compressed into the rhythmic pedaling left and right. Between heaven and earth, there were only us two. Tired bodies supported endlessly lively minds. We didn't even bother listening to music; our conversations were hard to end.

For seven years, Qinghai Lake has been expanding. A statue that stood by the shore in 2014 was half-submerged in water by 2021. I wondered if, in my lifetime, Qinghai Lake would reconnect with rivers and gradually become a freshwater lake. Would we come back then? Not daring to hope for another cycling trip, but at least to drink a large pot of milk tea in a tent. Then brag about how awesome it was.

Only the severe migraine from altitude sickness that lasted almost half the journey, several continuous 30-kilometer uphill climbs, occasional heavy rain, poor accommodation conditions, and the特有的拧巴劲 of文艺小登 in their mid-twenties could add a slight bitterness to this trip.

It's worth mentioning that the last day's ride was accompanied by continuous heavy rain and endless uphill climbs. We only had 6 of our original 24 Snickers bars left, and we were almost sick of Red Bull. In the afternoon, I faintly felt a chill at the base of my tongue and realized it was a bad sign. While resting 20 km from the finish line, ZL's sense of humor was still going strong, leaving behind the masterpiece "c1 peeing picture." Fortunately, a Tibetan truck driver asked if we needed help. The moment we sat in the warm, dry, air-conditioned cab, I realized how cold I was; I shivered for another ten minutes on the road.

Back in Xining, we devoured two pounds of hand-grabbed mutton. That was the last time I saw ZL until this autumn.

- We met a Hong Kong uncle with a flat tire. After helping him pump it up, he took this super cool photo for us.
- I retaliated by taking a picture of ZL peeing.
- The hand-grabbed mutton was incredibly delicious.

## (四) Long Time No See

When over seven hundred days and nights of压抑的时光 had crawled across the calendar, and a glimmer of light finally appeared in my work life, I decided to end this long self-exile. I planned to cross the ocean at the end of September to visit ZL, whom I hadn't seen for three whole years.

I don't know when it started, but the starting point of my travels always seems to be *after* the journey has begun. That is to say, there's no one or two weeks of anticipation before departure, no lying in bed every night imagining the wonderful things that will happen on this trip. There's only packing and leaving, and I was still dealing with work issues right before departure. This makes the whole process too理智 and lacking in emotion. This continued until I asked for a small bottle of wine on the plane. The warmth rising from my chest after drinking it dispelled this excess理智. Only then did my anticipation for the unknown and my nervousness about reuniting with an old friend I hadn't seen in so long start dancing in my mind.

After getting off the plane and exiting the station, I spotted him. He had cut his hair short and was no longer瘦小. Now he was a壮汉 with just the right hair length. Seeing each other, we couldn't suppress our rising smiles as we gradually approached each other. The old flame was reignited. The outdoor air was a bit crisp, and we ducked into his small car.
Soon, after the initial joy of reunion settled, I noticed—perhaps because it had been too long or due to the necessities of life in North America—that he seemed to have armed himself with a transparent shell, keeping me and all the world's unknowns outside. What he showed the world was an emotionally stable,壮硕 man. Yet, in certain moments, you could still glimpse that青涩的少年 beneath the shell.
Fortunately, it was an unstable shell. In ZL's small car, the passing scenery, under the influence of time, quickly crushed the shell. Within 36 hours, we were once again chatting and joking like in those Suzhou years, and shamelessly commenting on every girl who walked past us—except for Asian faces.

Among my many dreams of dissolving into the flow and being forgotten by the world, one was to drive on the PCH while listening to Jaden's song "PCH." Before reaching Monterey, I mentioned this to ZL. Without a word, he found the song and put it on repeat. Under the clear, sunny sky, by the misty,蔚蓝的海边, as the intro to "PCH" spilled out, the sea breeze took shape. We chased the constantly collapsing horizon, the rolling wheels continuously碾出来 new memories to patch over and cover my失落梦.

Sometimes the sunset was ahead of us. Fatigued by jet lag, I stared at the evening glow in silence. ZL, who was driving at the time, was also silent. Twilight mixed with灯光打在脸上. Under the gaze of the黄昏的众神, we drove toward the不朽的太阳, and within this silence was an永不间断的谈话. Then he broke the silence: "Tsk, need to find a song suitable for this moment," ZL said while fiddling with the main control screen.

- P1: ZL has many strange little things. After entering his home, I found a small round pair of sunglasses.
- P3: I brought that bottle of ice wine ZL gave me, which had accompanied me for five years, to the US and opened it with ZL to drink.
- P7: ZL said he really likes this photo, but it makes me look fat, which I don't really like.
- P9: Two weeks later, I stayed at ZL's place for another night when transiting through San Francisco on my way home.
