The title describes a phenomenon that sounds a bit silly but is actually quite common—at least for me, ~~and probably for you too.~~

This post was inspired by a moment of deep engagement in class today. It’s probably the most comfortable day of class I’ve had in a year.

## About Class

I haven’t been paying attention in class for over a year now. The reasons: sleeping too late, feeling too tired in class, and eventually just giving up. But today, on a whim, I decided to sit in the front row and listen. Surprisingly, it felt great.

## Reflections

I’m not sure if it’s because I’ve accumulated a bit of experience lately or for some other reason, but I found that both teachers in "Software System Analysis and Design" and "Software Testing and Evaluation" mentioned some points I strongly agree with. It’s like learning the hard way and then coming back to fix things.

+ The concept of systems
+ The importance of system design
+ The significance of requirements
+ Projects must have contracts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Alright, I don’t want to write anymore because I forgot the question I wanted to talk about.

Sad.
