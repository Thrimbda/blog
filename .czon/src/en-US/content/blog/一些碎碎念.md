"title": "Some Thoughts on Structure"
"summary": "This article explores the formation of the strong and the weak in society, the ways in which system rules are established (top-down or bottom-up), and the role of individual desires in system interactions from the perspective of personal momentum and system rules. The author argues that individuals exert influence within a system through momentum (i.e., effort and reward), while system rules are often set by elites (the strong), with the masses (the weak) surviving under these rules. Using examples from international society and corporate organizations, the article analyzes inequality, conflicts of desire, and the importance of system selection. Ultimately, it advises individuals to understand system rules and carefully choose the systems they interact with to maximize the satisfaction of their own desires."

Here are the clues I have gathered so far:

- I have come to realize that everyone has their own strengths; others are not fools.

- Therefore, when a person puts their mind to something, they often achieve results—this could be called a person's momentum.

- When a group of people operates under a system's rules, although various internal frictions may arise—such as two individuals striving in opposite directions, or issues in communication and collaboration—the momentum of each person combines to form the total momentum of the system.

- So, how are the rules of a system established? I can think of two ways: top-down or bottom-up, which correspond to the will of the masses and the will of the elites. This likely holds true in any organization—a family, a school class, a company, or even a nation.

- How do elites and masses emerge within a system? I believe this stems from the fundamental inequality among people, which can be considered a self-evident axiom in this framework. Consider an extreme example: the international society composed of nations in this world is a truly anarchic society, as there is no genuine authority to manage interactions between countries. Yet, we still observe distinctions between strong and weak nations. Within this anarchic societal framework, their strengths and weaknesses evolve and shift according to certain fundamental patterns. Delving deeper, endless explanations can be offered: the development and transformation of human social systems, cultural evolution determined by geography, similarities and differences between cultures, and the evolution of economic laws. Ultimately, at the highest level of abstraction, the observable phenomenon is that there is always a distinction between the strong and the weak. The strong set the rules, while the weak survive under these rules. There is also mutual transformation between the strong and the weak. Thus, we refer to the strong as elites and the weak as the masses. The number of elites is far smaller than that of the masses, and elites extract benefits from the masses.

- The international society formed by nations is a system, and a system formed by elementary school students is also a system. Larger systems can contain smaller ones. Among the strong, there are distinctions of strength and weakness; among the weak, there are also distinctions of strength and weakness. The absolute strong design systems for the weak, within which the relatively weak also have their own distinctions and interactions. The relatively weak, surviving within a system, often perceive that system as their entire world, unaware that they are living under a system designed by others—or even if aware, they may feel powerless to change it.

- People (among the strong) actively construct systems, and people also unconsciously form systems. However, the interaction between people and systems is not one-sided; systems, in turn, influence people. When entering this absurd game, people have initial positions and states, creating various additional inequalities beyond physiological ones. These layered inequalities constitute a person's overall inequality.

- But people have momentum; they are subjectively active. In the interactions between people and between people and systems, the strengths and weaknesses among individuals can transform, and systems can rise and fall. This manifests as a game gaining popularity, with everyone starting to play, or a game reaching its end and being abandoned by people.

- A person's momentum stems from their inner desires, released through their position and state within a system (intellectual level, era, country, family, influences from other people and systems). The existence of inner desires is also a self-evident axiom in this framework—it is the essence of human nature, not easily summarized but broadly understood as people striving to pursue immediate and long-term happiness and satisfaction.

- A person is a collection of desires. Desires can be long-term or short-term, and some desires may conflict with others. For example, a person may want to lose weight and get fit but also desires to eat delicious food in the moment—these two are somewhat contradictory. Under different systems, some desires are suitable for interaction within that system, while others are not. Our usual judgments about the goodness or badness of desires are often based on the worldview of a particular system. However, outside of a system, desires cannot be labeled as good or bad, superior or inferior.

- But a person's time and energy are limited; only a small portion of desires can be satisfied at any given time. For an individual, this is an operational challenge.

- Thus, we have depicted a dynamic worldview, which can be expanded to incorporate perspectives from the theory of contradictions for further explanation.

- Considering that I am working, many annoying issues arise, especially in so-called "big tech companies." A big tech company is also a system with various roles interacting under its rules. From the system's perspective:
  - Workers strive hard, complete tasks diligently, hoping for better performance to get promotions and salary increases. The system sets rules dictating how workers should achieve their desires. Thus, momentum converges to form the system's total momentum, enabling the big tech company to interact within the system of big tech companies.

  - Workers are the weak in this system, while bosses and senior leaders are the strong. The weak aspire to become strong, while the strong aim to remain strong and continuously extract benefits from the weak.

  - So, who sets the rules? This stems from the unconscious actions of workers (the weak) and the conscious actions of bosses and senior leaders (the strong). The unconscious actions of workers and the conscious actions of bosses can be understood as outlets for the release of abnormal total momentum (akin to a reduction of normal total momentum, similar to an individual's "lower" desires) under the system's rules. For example, bosses may want workers to endlessly expend their physical and intellectual efforts to provide momentum for the system (i.e., the company). Workers, however, may find this unbearable, leading to movements against 996 work schedules. Consequently, bosses may realize that prohibiting overtime might be a better rule.

  - Workers rarely realize that the rules of this system may not effectively satisfy their desires. After all, desires are often artificially created.

  - And the company is just one of countless systems. Interactions within this system may not benefit interactions in other systems (such as society or family), although bosses tend to make you believe a different story.

- As individuals, we have a responsibility for our own well-being. Therefore, we must carefully and cautiously choose the systems we interact with and the games we want to play. At the same time, we must recognize that some systems and games are imposed upon us. For such systems, we should understand their rules, the meaning behind these rules, and the connection between the system and ourselves. As a worker, my goals in choosing to work in a big tech company are:
  - To earn enough money to interact more effectively within the mandatory system of society.

  - To develop my skills to interact more effectively within broader, longer-lived systems like the industry or society.

  - Recognition from peers I respect.

  - The joy of solving problems.

  - An ultimate goal is to reshape these systems to some extent according to my desires through my efforts, or even to create entirely new systems.

- Ultimately, we want the ability and freedom to satisfy as many of our desires as possible under the rules of these imposed system frameworks.

- Therefore, I need to start from my own needs, understand the rules of the systems imposed upon us, understand the rules of the systems we are interested in, and assess to what extent interacting with these systems will satisfy our desires.
