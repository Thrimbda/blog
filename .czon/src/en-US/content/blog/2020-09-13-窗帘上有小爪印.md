"title": "Little Paw Prints on the Curtain"
"summary": "Using cat paw prints on a curtain as a starting point, the author reflects late at night on the passage of time, the witnessing of life, and personal growth. By revisiting Frank Lloyd Wright's autobiography, the author explores two core concepts: style and taste. Style is a unique expression that naturally emerges after a solid foundation is built, like in Van Gogh's paintings. Taste is the ability to appreciate art, constructed through training and life experiences, such as understanding Keats' poetry or the play 'Copenhagen.' The article combines personal experiences, like watching the play and reading the autobiography, to illustrate how these concepts influence life, ultimately returning to a longing for a rich and fulfilling existence."

A while ago, I returned to Suzhou. Grape (the cat) didn't come back with me. As I turned off the lights to sleep, I noticed several deep little paw prints on the curtain. I couldn't hold back any longer. In the deep of night, I got out of bed and began to ponder the more than half a month Grape spent alone at home—time, and the things that have flowed along with time, influencing my life.

In a previous article, we discussed the shape of time, its power, its playfulness and mockery. One point particularly worth emphasizing is that the speed at which time passes varies depending on a person's state. The Boss and I have observed that recently it seems to be accelerating exponentially—so much so that half of this year seems to have passed in an instant. Yet, upon careful thought, it seems last year was the same. I always feel like not much time has passed since I last wrote, but it has already been over a year.

Although this year passed quickly, it was also rich. Yet beyond richness, it carried more of life's essence and the witnessing of life.

And indeed, all of this began over a year ago, in the days before time started accelerating, with a book, an architect who wrote himself into its pages.

On February 11th of that year, daidai sent me a picture—the cover of a book that read: `An Autobiography: Frank Lloyd Wright`.

"You'll like it."

And so, this architect who hated sentimentality yet was exquisitely rich came to live in my mind.

By revisiting his life, he taught me two important things for witnessing this world:

The first is **style**. The formation of style requires time as a catalyst. First, we need to solidly master the basics, reaching a state where we can act freely without overstepping boundaries. Using riding a bicycle as an analogy: in the end, you don't need your hands to steer, but your body, or your heart. If you think about riding over the solid line on the bike lane, you won't deviate. After the foundation is laid, it becomes a specific creative process. Facing a problem domain, we raise the questions that trouble us on the critical path, then use the foundation we've built to solve problems or express emotions.

**At the moment we put the final period, style quietly arrives. What's left to do is to welcome and appreciate it. This is a joyful moment.**

What is style? It's like tangible colors in the objective world. Take Van Gogh's paintings: he would exaggeratedly express certain phenomena existing in the world, not sparing his paint, and in some parts, quite sketchy, creating a strong distinctiveness. This distinctiveness can be said to be the embodiment of style. However, everyone appreciates this beauty in different ways, appreciates his paintings, or may not even find them beautiful. Is the understanding of style a completely subjective feeling?

What is good style? This leads to the second important thing the architect discussed: **taste**. Who possesses such good taste that they can appreciate a specific work of art and savor the palpable style within it?

Like the cypress trees and starry night in Van Gogh's brushstrokes; the haunting song of the nightingale in Keats' poetry; Beethoven's picturesque, vibrant Sixth Symphony. These universally acclaimed excellent works are each unique, yet they all possess a solid, exquisite power that can transcend time and space, cross the barriers of the human heart, make people firm, give them meaning, and lend coherence to life.

Yet appreciating these works undoubtedly requires a certain degree of training. Take "Ode on Melancholy" as an example: `Aye, in the very temple of delight, Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine`. When I first read it, I was just at the age of having an adult mind but little worldly experience. I only felt the meaning of this line was obscure. As I learned about Keats' life and began to pay homage to the shrine of melancholy in my own life, it started to grow in my heart in a unique way.

Or take drama as an example: `"Why did Heisenberg return to Copenhagen in 1941?"` Why did that brief meeting at Bohr's home in Copenhagen end the twenty-year friendship between Heisenberg and Bohr? This question, which has haunted the public for over half a century, serves as the clue in the play "Copenhagen," forming the background and foundational framework of the entire drama. In reality, it cleverly portrays just how complex the human heart can be. Behind a single decision and action collapsed into reality, there may lie a dozen or dozens of motives in a state of superposition.

Heisenberg was an old friend of the Bohr family and also a German sharing war guilt; he was like Bohr's most outstanding son, while also bearing the roles of husband and father himself. And his motives were even more numerous than his identities: Did Heisenberg want to prevent the birth of nuclear weapons? Did he want to shoulder the burden of reviving the entire German scientific community? Was it because Heisenberg became Germany's youngest professor? Or was Heisenberg simply like a homesick child? Or perhaps Heisenberg himself didn't even know why he came? And this state of confusion and chaos expanded exponentially like a chain reaction, ultimately saving all the cities not bombed with nuclear weapons by Axis Germany. Humanity! A collection of contradictions!

![Copenhagen](https://0xc1.space/images/2020/09/13/copenhagen.jpg)

In the summer of 2018, Little Lion took me to see this play on the Peking University campus. Since then, it has lingered in my mind, growing richer with each revisit. This is perhaps the process of building taste: first entering my memory, and as life goes on, scenes from the play are enacted in reality in various different yet connected ways, allowing me to appreciate it further. At the same time, it also guides my real life, granting equal respect to the dozen or so motives behind others' decisions.

So what is taste?

You could say taste is entirely dogmatic, a logically self-consistent virtual system that builds bridges between human hearts, with destinations completely unrestricted. You could also say taste should be objective, transcending human likes and dislikes, merely a reflection of the real world in the human heart.

The architect didn't provide an answer; he simply assumed taste exists. Dogma or objective existence—they are contradictory yet unified. It must reflect some attribute of reality, hardly contradicting it, yet also not stopping at reality and mechanical materialism. It provides guidance for human reason and aesthetics, constructing civilization upon the foundation of the real environment. These rich works provide me with raw materials. Like poetry, I might not understand them at first meeting, but with frequent recollection and resonance, they constitute my taste.

Style and taste, like `apply` and `eval`, follow the way of nature, constructing the architect's tumultuous yet abundant life.

*Every time I open that autobiography, no matter my mood, I ultimately return to a harmonious tranquility. How should a person spend their life? I hope to be as rich as the architect.*

When I read about Frank's final decision to join Sullivan's firm and say goodbye to his former boss, there is a passage in his autobiography described like this:

![Pain](https://0xc1.space/images/2020/09/13/pain.jpg)

This scene stayed in my memory for a long time. It wasn't until I had a similar experience that I realized all the preparation was useless; the pain came unexpectedly. Just like the little paw prints on the curtain, during the days and nights I was away, Grape walked onto the bay window countless times, scratching the curtain with her little paws, earnestly hoping that the moment she scratched, I would appear behind the curtain to playfully respond. She scratched and scratched, her claws—sharp from not being trimmed for too long—hooking onto the curtain, pulling out those little paw prints.
