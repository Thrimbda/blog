"title": "I Finally Thought of the Answer, but Wait... What Was the Question?"
"summary": "This article documents the author's positive experience of sitting in the front row and attentively listening to lectures after a long period of inattentiveness. In the courses 'Software System Analysis and Design' and 'Software Testing and Evaluation,' the author resonated with the instructors' points on system concepts, the importance of system design, the significance of requirements, and the necessity of signing contracts for projects. The article begins humorously, describing the common phenomenon of thinking of an answer but forgetting the question, which leads into reflections on the lectures. It ends with the author forgetting the intended topic, expressing a sense of helplessness and sadness."

The title describes a phenomenon that may sound odd but is actually quite common—at least for me, ~~and surely for you too.~~

This post was inspired by a moment of deep engagement during today's lectures, which were probably the most enjoyable classes I've attended in about a year.

## About Attending Lectures

I haven't paid attention in class for over a year now, mainly because I stay up too late, get too sleepy during lectures, and eventually gave up trying. But today, on a whim, I decided to sit in the front row and listen—surprisingly, it felt great.

## Reflections

I'm not sure if it's because I've accumulated a bit of experience lately or for some other reason, but I found that both instructors in 'Software System Analysis and Design' and 'Software Testing and Evaluation' mentioned points I strongly agree with. It feels like coming back to fix the fence only after the sheep have already escaped.

+ The concept of a system
+ The importance of system design
+ The importance of requirements
+ Projects must have a signed contract!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Alright, I don't want to write anymore because I've forgotten the question I wanted to discuss.

Sadness.
