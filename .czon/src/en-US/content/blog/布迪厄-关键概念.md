"title": "Analysis of Bourdieu's Key Concepts"
"summary": "This article elaborates on Bourdieu's sociological theories, focusing on key concepts such as habitus, field, and capital. Habitus, as a structured and structuring structure, reconciles social structure and individual agency. The field is seen as a social space of struggle, where the distribution of capital (e.g., economic, cultural, symbolic) determines positions and power relations. The article also discusses derived concepts like doxa, hysteresis, and interest, and points out how Bourdieu critically inherits the ideas of Marx, Weber, Durkheim, and others, attempting to transcend the opposition between subjectivism and objectivism through a 'realist third way.' These theories provide a framework for analyzing social class, cultural distinction, and symbolic struggle."

# Bourdieu's Key Concepts

## Biography

Bourdieu opposed biographical research.
>
> He rejected this constructed 'life' because such construction always exists within a coherence and always implies either subjective or objective intentions behind the individual's involved actions. He found a specific expressive tendency in the writings of biographers: 'already,' 'from then on,' 'from his earliest youth,' 'always.' In short, Bourdieu opposed this neat, chronological description of people's lives, which, in his view, were artificially ordered, if not predestined.

Human life is not always accompanied by order; people act with 'uncertainty.' Therefore, such post-hoc accounts are misleading, representing the biographer's attribution of meaning to the subject's life. Any attribution cannot fully reflect the true situation at the time; it is a re-creation. This re-creation, embodying the author's own biases, may cause the biography to lose its objectivity.

Bourdieu's Life.

1.  Born in 1930 in a French village.
2.  Graduated from the École Normale Supérieure, alumni include Sartre, de Beauvoir, Derrida.
3.  Taught in a secondary school for one year after graduation.
4.  1955: Served in the military in Algeria, managed a library during this time—an important experience.
5.  1960: Returned to France, became an assistant to Raymond Aron.
6.  1964: Editor of the "Le Sens Commun" series, translated many important academic texts in the social sciences.
7.  1984: Entered politics.
8.  2001: Retired, passed away the following year.

Individuals who influenced Bourdieu's thought:
-   Enlightenment thinkers - Montesquieu, Tocqueville, Voltaire, Auguste Comte
-   Sociology - Marx, Weber, Durkheim
-   Existentialism - Sartre, de Beauvoir
-   Objectivism - Claude Lévi-Strauss
-   Phenomenology - Merleau-Ponty

Bourdieu's Thought:
-   Using Marx against Marx, Weber against Weber, Durkheim against Durkheim. The 'realist third way' is an attempt to revive Marxist practical philosophy while discarding '19th-century political rhetoric' and communist propaganda.
-   The 'opposition' between subjectivism and objectivism that has emerged in the social sciences is 'the most fundamental and the most destructive.'

*Subjectivism* - Subjectivism holds that 'our mental activity is the only indubitable fact of our experience.' It is not shareable, not public, and there is no external, objective truth.

*Existentialism* - Existentialism (French: Existentialisme) is a philosophical thought where life becomes aware of its own existence and explores, pursues, resolves, and optimizes everything about its life centered on the 'I.'

*Objectivism* - Objectivism is a philosophical system proposed by Russian-American philosopher and writer Ayn Rand. Objectivism holds that: reality exists independently of subjective consciousness; each person is directly connected to reality through sensation; humans can acquire objective knowledge from sensation through concept formation and logical induction and deduction; the moral meaning of life lies in the pursuit of personal happiness or rational self-interest; the only social system compatible with this morality is one that fully respects individual rights, embodied as pure laissez-faire capitalism; the role of art is to transform man's metaphysical views into physical forms—artworks—that he can understand and react to emotionally, through a selective recreation of reality.

*Structuralism* - Structuralism (French: Structuralisme) is a scientific school that focuses on understanding structure rather than pursuing knowledge of essence, promotes interdisciplinary exchange, and advocates for a holistic science that seeks underlying relationships beneath surface phenomena to obtain universally applicable structures. Structuralism was a popular method for analyzing language, culture, and society in the latter half of the 20th century.

Bourdieu:

***Field** - **Capital** - **Habitus***

## Habitus

>
> Empirically, we often feel we are free agents, yet the various decisions we make daily are often based on predictable, prescribed behaviors and the attitudes of others.

How are social structure and individual agency reconciled, and how can we have the 'external' and 'internal' shape each other?

Bourdieu defines habitus as a property of social agents. It contains what is called a 'structured structure' and a 'structuring structure.'

Structured structure: Achieved through a person's past and present situation, such as family background or educational experience.

Structuring structure: How a person's habitus helps shape their present and future practices.

Structure: The resulting systematic order, not random or unformed.

【(Habitus)(Capital)】+ Field = Practice

Habitus and field mutually constitute each other; they can become misaligned (lagging behind the times).

Habitus is one of Bourdieu's most crucial concepts.

## Field

Field - Social space - A particularly internal territorial scope, a site of struggle.

There are different positions (capital) within a field.

c1: Contradictions develop within/between fields.

Football field
Rules, game, internal divisions, and external boundaries.

Force field in science fiction
A self-contained microcosm with hierarchies, predictability.

Force field
A field can be conceived as the result of multiple forces and counter-forces, a field of power.

Studying a field:
1.  Analyze the field's position in relation to the field of power.
2.  Map the objective structure of relations between positions, which will be occupied by social agents or institutions.
3.  Analyze the habitus of the social agents.

Problems arising from field theory:
1.  The problem of marginal zones - the issue of drawing boundaries.
2.  The problem of too many fields.
3.  The problem of change within a field - non-deterministic, developmental.
4.  The problem of inter-field connections.

## Various Aspects of Field Operation

-   The field and social class labels, and what these labels imply.
-   Capital and circulation.
-   Discussion of doxa, how social phenomena evolve.
-   The hysteresis problem when habitus and field are out of sync.

### Social Class

>
> What Bourdieu insisted on is that social class must play a role in the mainstream context and be examined sociologically at the cultural level.

-   Social Space
    Position (sense of place) and Habitus

    First, determine an individual's position in social space - measured by the types (cultural capital, economic capital) and volume of their capital.

    Individuals in similar positions (capital) have a higher probability of having similar habitus, thus constituting a class.

    Examples:
    -   Artisans face higher survival urgency, therefore dislike 'frills.'
    -   More affluent white-collar workers are freer to pursue more aestheticized things.

-   Distinction:
    A cluster of objects in social space that develop their own cultural traits, distinguishing them from others. They are devoted to symbolic struggles, attempting to establish the superiority of their cultural traits while also seeking official recognition. Symbolic struggle is somewhat like class struggle.

    Be wary of 'classification.' Classification itself may represent a bias. Who established the authority of the classification? No one. Especially for less natural, higher-level classifications, acceptance of a particular classification method signifies a group's successful struggle for cultural capital.

### Symbolic Capital

What is capital?

Bourdieu believed the economic definition of capital was too narrow, focused on 'commodity exchange.' It should actually be applied to a broader range of exchanges.

Various forms of capital:
-   Symbolic Capital
    -   Cultural Capital
    -   Linguistic Capital
    -   Scientific Capital
    -   Literary Capital
-   Economic Capital

Symbolic capital is essentially about occupying the high ground of human taste, possessing the power to define 'what is good.'

Symbolic capital:
-   They are objectified or embodied.
-   They require time to acquire.
-   Their acquisition occurs through a systematic process of inculcation.
-   They express the (external) habitus of the delegating institutions of power responsible for inculcation and their fields.
-   They bring value to social agents, the standard being how 'well-constructed' the individual's (internal) habitus is relative to the inculcation within the field.
-   They vary in their trans-field applicability.

Various forms of symbolic capital.

### Doxa

Answers several questions:
-   What is doxa?
-   What is unique about doxa?
-   What can we do?

Doxa is:
>
> Doxa refers to a pre-reflexive, primordial knowledge shaped by experience, a bodily unconscious inheritance, a relational presupposition.
>
> Doxa is 'a set of fundamental beliefs which do not even need to be asserted in the form of an explicit, self-conscious dogma' (Bourdieu 2000a:16).
>
> Tradition is silent; it does not need to proclaim itself as 'tradition.'

Therefore, it is naturally closely related to field and habitus.

c1: Doxa is like a mental imprint. The reason symbolic capital requires significant time to accumulate is that instilling doxa in people takes time—it's about shaping this mental imprint through repetition. Once 'doxa is formed,' people's habitus is shaped accordingly. Moreover, since doxa is not subject to rational inquiry, it becomes the most deeply ingrained part of habitus.

Doxa itself also constitutes a kind of field.

### Hysteresis

The phenomenon of disjunction that occurs when habitus and field interact and co-evolve.

Hysteresis attempts to describe this disjunction in a more non-tendentious way, unlike 'alienation.' Bourdieu did not believe there was a moral standard to judge whether this disjunction was good or bad.

The rupture between habitus and field creates hysteresis. An example is 'Don Quixote.'
>
> No matter how hard he tries, Don Quixote's chivalric disposition fails to achieve his expected goals, which past experience suggested he could attain. Conversely, his audience, those who can fully naturalize the sense of the game, see his behavior as incredible, incomprehensible, and comical.

-   What prompts changes in field and habitus?
    1.  External fields change, directly affecting the current field - e.g., war.
    2.  The habitus of some individuals within the field changes with the development of contradictions, thereby driving field change - e.g., national reform.
    As individuals living in many fields, how can we keenly notice changes in the field, and how can we contribute to field change?

## Field Conditions

### Interest

Bourdieu considered 'interest' the core driving force behind individual practices within various fields.

>
> We note that for the ways individuals engage in social practices to position themselves, Bourdieu considered strategy a better concept. However, this practice is not merely based on the connection between personal habitus and their surrounding field conditions, but more on an unconscious calculation of interest (fundamentally, how to improve one's position within the field). In this way, they obtain a personal interest.
>
>
> Interest needs to be realized through operation within the relationship between field and habitus.
>
> We exist under 'regularities' and 'dispositions,' not laws.
>
> Interest is thus a concept whose use is to view social practice as a game and also as an economic game. In other words, individual action aims to maximize interest. However, such action is not merely a simple calculated choice or conscious decision; we must also judge how to obtain maximum benefit while considering costs.

Interest exists widely in various social formations. In pre-capitalist societies, interest might manifest through honor or virtue: meaning people in such societies might not pursue the accumulation of economic capital but instead seek symbolic capital.

Bourdieu believed there are as many interests as there are fields.

Interest exists widely in:
-   Education - The ideology education seeks to inculcate is based on the culture of a particular class, fostering empathy and consensus with that class among the educated that might not have existed otherwise. In this process, the culturally dominant class expands its rule.
-   Art and Literature
>
>    For Kant, experience could only be thought of as existing within an aesthetic realm of disinterestedness, free from any desire, requiring and benefiting from the precise existence of the object's representation. All this was distorted into a 'pure' taste.

    This relates to what Frank Lloyd Wright referred to as taste.

    I once wondered, what is good taste? Is there really a commonality in the appreciation of 'beauty' at the level of all humanity? If so, why can taste be trained? Bourdieu's concepts of interest/capital make it much easier to explain.
-   Economy - Economic interest is taken for granted in capitalist society.

>
> These two theories claim that individuals' choices of action are based on clearly discernible options that are visible and the result of calculation. In Bourdieu's view, both are idealistic in the extreme. They ignore the fact that any individual habitus is 'rational' action, or at least reasoned, because it presupposes possession of economic and cultural capital within a specific and appropriate social spacetime. The calculation of opportunity—which is only feasible, possible, and potential—can only be made based on concrete social and economic conditions, to finally recognize the existence of opportunity: 'because it must assume a universality arising from nothing, a pre-construction of interest, and rational action theory completely forgets the social genesis of the historical variation of interests.'
