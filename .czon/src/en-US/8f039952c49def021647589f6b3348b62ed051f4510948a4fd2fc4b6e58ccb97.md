### 2020-04-13

- Completed self-performance review
- Revisions for Lane Center Aggregation

### 2020-04-14

- [ ] Speed limit compilation
- [ ] Custom speed limits

### 2020-04-15

- Determined the custom speed limit solution with @guangcong
  1. Use a new `module-dynamicEvent` to solve this problem
  2. Custom speed limit updates act as a new event to trigger horizon data updates
  3. Need to consider exception handling and memory issues
     After discussing with Guangcong, he encountered some problems
- Xiaokang's review
  Java, as a solid language, still has a lot to offer
- Speed limit compilation
  Basically no progress, added logic for extracting RoadCenterTile
- Solved the Sectioning problem, analyzed the edgeLifting optimization scheme, proposed an optimization algorithm:
  Given a traverse head and a connectivity function, provide the traversal method
- Researched the principle of self-executing Jars

### 2020-04-16

- Clarified the custom speed limit interface with Yiming: He guarantees that the input location pair can uniquely determine a shortest route
  Returned and outlined the algorithm for generating custom speed limits with Guangcong
  1. Given a route
  2. Known: | start DiRoadOnPath::count - end DiRoadOnPath::count | ≤ 1
     Then a pair (start DiRoadOnPath, end DiRoadOnPath) that yields the shortest distance can definitely be found
- Temporarily released a usable snapshot version pylon-v0.1.1 compiler for Xiaokang
- Went downstairs for a random walk and chatted with Hanteng
- Clarified the SUMO map usage interface with Zizhe and Yicheng
- Speed Limit compilation succeeded but not yet verified

### 2020-04-17

- SpeedLimit compilation verification:
  OSMSerializable is not quite suitable because SpeedLimit after binding has no geometry
  Potential issue: Speed limit binding might have problems when ramps merge
- [ ] Interpolation
- [ ] Hausdorff distance
- [ ] LcInJunctionTile

#### Some Random Thoughts

- Go straight to Spark?
- What does OSM's Context need?

### 2020-04-18

Completed speed limits.

### 2020-04-20

#### Custom Speed Limits

- Guangcong changed the input to a vector and added tests
- A minor issue is that Guangcong doesn't truly understand how C++ pointers work
- [ ] Maybe try to solve [https://github.com/scalameta/scalafmt/issues/337](https://github.com/scalameta/scalafmt/issues/337)?
- [ ] Make the file shared by Uncle available for anonymous sharing via Resilio Sync

#### RoadBorder Fix

Discovered I made a wrong assumption. The lc and rb information recorded in rc might have:

1. Only one lc exists, so cannot assume lc has at least two
2. rb on one side might not exist, so cannot assume rb always exists

### 2020-04-21

#### RoadBorder Fix

- Completed migration of test cases
- Improved Dune and its ReadMe so it can directly output test data
  Chatted with Weiyu, looking ahead, I will focus on the compilation system

#### Opposite Lane POI Binding

- Binding for data after multidigitize

### 2020-04-22

#### Opposite Lane POI Binding

- Binding for data after multidigitize
- Construct test data

### 2020-04-23

- Completed opposite lane POI binding and finished debugging [4]

### 2020-04-27

Main tasks today:

#### Completed synchronizing mdm proto and mdm spec

1. Modified incorrectly described parts in the mdm spec with Linnan
2. Left several pending items that Linnan and I couldn't decide alone
3. Decided in the 2020-04-26 morning meeting to postpone the most troublesome modifications for LaneSplitMerge and Polyline
4. Completed proto modifications
5. Completed nexus modifications
6. Completed mdk modifications
7. Also incidentally fixed a test data issue (tons of data errors reported)

#### Bug Fixes

Approaching the 430 release, bug count surged.

[HDMAPMDK-1111](https://jira.momenta.works/browse/HDMAPMDK-1111) analysis completed

- [ ] Script for automatically copying test cases
- [ ] Export Apple Reminder

### 2020-04-28

Spent half a day taking the driving theory test (Subject 1)

HDMAPMDK-1130 width issue, three problems:

1. Spec states no lane width during lane changes
2. Split line caused by intersection lines being too long

HDMAPMDK-1121 re-fix

State is extremely poor.

### 2020-04-29

#### Bugfix

- HDMAPMDK-1143
  Issue where RoadObstacle was not compiled
- HDMAPMDK-1090

### 2020-05-06

#### Du Valid

- Using mill
- Using nexus-osm

#### Brainstorm

### 2020-05-08

#### Memory Leak Issue

- The direct cause of the memory leak was not deleting wild pointers after `new`
- After updating the current position, map kit calls `prepareGuidanceData` to find the guidance data closest to the current position
- `prepareGuidanceData` calls `NavInfoProviderImpl::getTrafficLights` & `NavInfoProviderImpl::getCarParks`
- Taking `NavInfoProviderImpl::getTrafficLights` as an example, it `new`s data pointers in `NaviEventOnPath` when called
- However, there is no `delete`
- Also found `DestEvent` has this issue

Solution: The core is to disallow wild pointers. Decided to refactor `NaviEventProvider`

- First, add two fields `traffic_light_events` & `car_park_events` to `NaviInfoProvider`
- In `NaviInfoGenerator`, update these two fields after the route is updated
- Then filter based on the current vehicle position during each `get`
- Therefore, need to refactor `PathReader::getAttributes` because the previous implementation only considered offset relative to the current vehicle; now an interface for offset relative to the Path is needed.

### 2020-05-09

#### PolyLine Fix and Testing

The main issue with PolyLine is that duplicate points might be added during PolyLine generation, leading to a series of geometry-related segment calculation problems:

1. Vector calculation: two duplicate points result in a zero vector
2. Length calculation: segment length is 0, easily causing NaN issues

Therefore, when constructing a PolyLine, check the points within it. If duplicate points are found, throw an exception.

Identified the following issues:

- Problems with `getEnd` in Jts
- `Jts LinearLocation` has a `normalize` issue

  ```scala
  val loc1 = new LinearLocation(0, 1, 1.0)
  val loc2 = new LinearLocation(0, 2, 0.0)

  loc1 compareTo loc2
  // the output is -1
  ```

- When interpolating, points that are too close might be selected

### 2020-05-11

- HDMAPMDK-1122
  Could not reproduce the missing road edge line issue, decided not to spend more time investigating the cause
- Half an hour on Metabolic Growth Theory
- Refactored Visitor to support lines with the same start and end points
- Prepared an interview question

### 2020-05-12

- Interview: Both candidates were unqualified. Thought about how to quickly screen candidates. Took 3 hours.
- Bugfix: HDMAPMDK-1211 Deleting incorrect border issue, not successfully fixed in the last fix.
  Had an idea but didn't finish writing it.
- Went to the gym.

### 2020-05-13

Bugfix: HDMAPMDK-1211 Thought of a solution.

- Root cause: Unreasonable production line segmentation.

#### Root Cause Analysis

It can be seen that segmentation occurs before the lane change is complete (the lane centerline is still crossing the lane line), and this segmentation can potentially cross Rps.

The lane border observation information attached to the lane center shape points faithfully records the lane lines on both sides using a scan line method based on geometry, without semantic filtering. Therefore, at positions where lane lines cross lanes, the lane centerline intersecting with the lane line will record that lane line on both left and right lane border refs.

Under the existing code logic, when filtering intersecting lane line border refs based on semantics, the border refs to be deleted are inferred based on the lane change type.

The current logic fails when encountering this type of segmentation, leading to this problem.

#### Solution

The core is to **find the lane change trend of the intersecting lane line**. Considering that this type of segmentation may cross Rps, filtering should not be performed per Rp.

1. First, organize lane lines into paths using edge lifting (can be considered for future graph refactoring): `Seq[LaneCenter]`
2. Find the lane Center to be corrected and the lane border to be corrected (assuming such lane Centers are caused by lane changes)
3. Calculate the lane change trend of this LaneCenter based on the laneCenter path
4. Perform filtering

Assigned to Ziliang.

Interviewed one person, didn't pass.

### 2020-05-14

HDMAPMDK-1132 Id tracing for pole sign lane line endpoints.

The tracing problem for pole sign lane line endpoints is much simpler compared to linear object tracing, involving only Id mapping, not offset and length mapping.

However, there are still many issues to consider:

1. Procedure
2. The Id Typing System is a persistent issue that needs to be addressed.

The root cause of this problem is essentially that we used Long Ids for all Id definitions, while MDM definitions use Ints, potentially causing overflow issues.

### 2020-05-15

#### Bug Fixes

- HDMAPMDK-1215 completed
- HDMAPMDK-1218 Done

### 2020-05-18

Refactored the OSM Assembler, used the previous OSM serialize, improving both code comprehensibility and ease of writing.

### 2020-05-19

Fixed a bug in the OSM Assembler (not really a bug).

Had the sprint planning meeting today:
Not many tasks for this sprint, but a lot to think about. This is a healthy state.

### 2020-05-20

- [ ] Write documentation describing the current nexus/mdk CI status and requirements.
- [x] Follow up on HDMAPMDK-1263 bug
  - Indeed a production line segmentation issue
- [ ] Schedule a meeting with Yang Chuan to discuss CI
- [ ] HDMAPMDK-1262
      Didn't finish.
- [x] Custom Speed Limit issue

### 2020-05-21

#### TODOs

- [x] Greet Qiaobo
- [x] HDMAPMDK-1262
- [x] HDMAPMDK-755

#### Works

- Went to Yiming's workstation in the morning for online debugging of yesterday's hotfix. The cause was an offset issue. Wrote it too hastily yesterday and didn't add any tests. This kind of behavior shouldn't happen again. Thought I saved a lot of time, **but ended up wasting more time**.
- The reason for not getting data in 1262 is that MDK didn't load lane-level road marks (and road obstacles)
- Helped Brother Du compile data.

### 2020-05-22

What did I do today???
What did I do???

### 2020-05-25

Received a new task today: HDMAPMDK-1249 - Research methods for calculating lane aggregation using road geometry information. This increased the tasks for this week. Currently, I have three things to do:

1. 1249
2. Current status, requirements, and plan for the team's CI Pipeline
3. Nexus graph refactoring

Each requires careful thought and is not easy. Unfortunately, I can't accurately estimate the time for each, only Weiyu's estimates written as story points in the Jira tasks. One thing is clear: **If I don't start estimating and reviewing, I'll never estimate accurately.** So starting this time, I need to estimate carefully.

Also, I plan to start 1249 today because it's a business matter, generally more urgent, and Weiyu cares more about it. As for refactoring, if I don't take it seriously, probably no one else will (because, cruelly, it doesn't affect functionality but efficiency, and efficiency is the hardest to measure; even I only have qualitative analysis).

### 2020-05-26

Many unexpected things happened today. First, parking reported two bugs. Originally planned for delivery today, but due to these bugs, delivery couldn't happen. Wang Wei negotiated with downstream to postpone delivery by two days to the day after tomorrow. So my main work for these two days became fixing bugs again. This made me think about whether the scheduling during delivery is reasonable. Then there was the HDMAPMDK-1290 issue.

Completed today:

- Follow-up on HDMAPMDK-1290: When extremely close to the stop line, the matched lane offset can be longer than the lane length.

  > Spent almost the whole day investigating and trying to solve this problem (currently 8:56 PM), efficiency was very low.

  The root cause is that MDK calculates length by taking a coordinate transform for every two points, which, while more accurate, leads to strong uncertainty in the result.

  Finally used a hacky solution: if the calculated offset is longer than the length, just take the length.

- HDMAPMDK-1297 Incorrect parking space binding.
  Even though it's almost the original off-work time (9 PM), I must at least analyze this problem today!
  Sigh, got it done. Turned out to be a simple problem.

### 2020-05-27

If nothing unexpected happens, I should finish the CI Pipeline work today.

But something unexpected happened - -

Received bug feedback from Yiming:

1. Traffic light binding: Traffic lights that should be bound to the waiting area were bound to the partition before the waiting area. Fixed (1.5h)
2. Missing traffic light binding: Could not reproduce.
   Update: After a difficult round of debugging, finally found the issue. During compilation, the geometry used for binding rc and offset was not the same line, causing the offset to exceed the road length, so the traffic light couldn't be found (2h)

### 2020-05-28

Driving test (Subject 2) tomorrow, practiced driving all day today, came back at 5 PM. Feeling good, hope to pass tomorrow.

Started describing the current status and requirements analysis for the CI Pipeline - -

### 2020-05-29

Didn't pass. Sigh, it's so hard for me.

Went for the test in the morning, did a few things in the afternoon:

1. Went to Yiming's place to check an abnormal situation, turned out to be two bugs.
2. After the afternoon townhall, synchronized about the MDK Python binding.
3. Went downstairs with Shan Le and Weiyu to solve a downstream issue, finally summarized a short-term solution and a long-term solution.

I found that when encountering unexpected problems, the general problem-solving method should be this pattern:
A short-term solution and a long-term solution. Because the value exposed by a problem is certain and time-sensitive. Therefore, the short-term solution focuses on quickly and accurately solving the immediate problem. Is a long-term solution still needed? Generally yes, because a specific case of a problem reflects a blind spot in previous solutions that wasn't considered. Analyzing the root cause and systematically solving it makes the solution more complete for this class of problems. There are cases where a long-term solution isn't needed: after thorough analysis, we conclude that the cost of systematically solving the problem outweighs the benefits. (Even so, subjectively, most of us still want to solve it systematically. As engineers, who doesn't want to solve problems systematically? But this leaves a trap, making people potentially solve important but not urgent matters, or matters that are neither important nor urgent, wasting precious time that could be used to solve other more valuable problems.)

4. Came back in the evening and continued working on the CI Pipeline.

### 2020-06-01

Went to Yiming's place first thing in the morning to analyze a problem, spent the whole morning. The result was a known issue from before (point loss caused by interpolation in the old compiler) leading to another problem: during route capture, exactly near the missing segment, causing a negative lane offset.

Worked until quite late, 4 PM. After an inefficient and painful late-night session (feeling that in the current state, staying up late is basically linked to low efficiency).

### 2020-06-02

Came in the afternoon. To prepare for Yiming's vehicle deployment, solved some bugs, caught up with Yiming's evening deployment.

### 2020-06-03

Went to help Yiming solve problems discovered last night first thing in the morning, specifically the issue of not being able to get traffic lights.

### 2020-06-04

Three things to do this morning:

1. Data cleaning and uploading the final 0605 data
2. Check width anomaly issue - because there is no lane at that position
3. Check issue of interpolation points assigned to wrong lanes
4. Review

### 2020-06-05

A tense and exciting day. Completed HDMAPMDK-1347 and HDMAPMDK-1352, and also did a major refactoring.

Learned a valuable lesson: Don't make huge changes close to delivery. Without sufficient QA testing, even the most awesome refactoring can bring risks. Also, without enough time for design review (I mean for myself, because sometimes while writing, you might discover the design is wrong. However, discovering design issues during implementation is another problem—starting implementation too early).

Monday addition:
During this tense and exciting day of refactoring, I was almost non-stop, even来不及 to think, relying on familiarity and flow to write code with extremely high efficiency. Actually, if we disregard the principle of not doing major refactoring before delivery, I really enjoyed this state. But everything needs a goal and meaning; can't just focus on personal enjoyment, otherwise that enjoyment becomes a low-level pleasure.

### 2020-06-08

Moved to work in Beijing on Saturday.

The feeling of returning to work in Beijing is really a bit disorienting. Everything has changed. First, I lost my workstation (Xiuyun recruited an intern, and for convenience, her intern is sitting there). This is the most uncomfortable part of all the losses. It's like when I moved to Class 1 in my second year of high school, sitting in a new seat knowing no one, not wanting to talk to them. The people here seem familiar yet strange. I seem to feel I have few friends here, which I rationally judge is an illusion. But the feeling of not wanting to communicate, wanting to find a corner to stay in, is real, and I did find a corner to stay in, next to Yuzhang. Why don't I want to communicate? I still can't figure it out. Maybe because there's no good reason? When asked why I came to Beijing and how long I'll stay, I hesitantly said for a while, a month or two; or maybe it shows that I'm essentially an introverted person, unwilling to trouble others, especially concerned about looking foolish in others' eyes. However, the more I write, the more I feel the second reason is more prominent and unnecessary. First, looking foolish is better than actually being foolish. Sincerely asking others for help, even if clumsy, is fine. Don't be afraid, don't be afraid when you're young. Don't be afraid anytime. All is well.

Now about work. Finished the delivery busy period recently, mainly the TLM (typed lane model) refactoring. This time, need to clarify goals and control myself, not refactor impulsively. Need to be strategic and control my progress.

Also, I got my desktop computer working. The reason it couldn't connect to the internet before was that I changed the password. After a power outage, the network connection was completely lost. So need to set up the machine. This time the priorities are:

1. Productivity
2. Coolness
3. Good looks

Spent a long time reading Wang Yin's blog today - - ongoing detox. I used to be a fanatical religious person, unable to see the essence of things. I always thought something was the ultimate solution to all problems, but in reality, such "ultimate solutions" are rare. Most of the time, it's just religious fanaticism, like:

- Vim vs Emacs
- OOP vs FP
- Go vs Rust

And so on... When I first encountered OOP, I thought OOP was invincible, could solve everything, but ended up just writing a giant God class; actually, having that class or not didn't matter, what was useful were the functions under that class. Later (these past two years) encountering FP, I thought FP was the silver bullet for everything. But after writing programs in Scala for a while, I found my productivity didn't improve well; instead, I became less efficient due to纠结 over syntax and Immutable.

### 2020-06-09

Found some rhythm, installed Arch, feels even more comfortable to use than Mac?

Played Hearthstone Battlegrounds with Yuzhang for a while - -

### 2020-06-10

Planned to do these things today:

1. HDMAPMDK-1199 RoadMark becomes a subclass, providing richer information
2. HDMAPMDK-892 Provide empirical trajectories

If there's energy left, work on the release documentation.

Result: Finished 892.

### 2020-06-11

Reviewed HDMAPMDK-892 - Provide empirical trajectories.

Found MDK hasn't done the corresponding adaptation, spent the afternoon doing this adaptation.

Finished the adaptation, so tired.

Continued tinkering with my Arch, trying to record some steps of my setup as part of automation.

### 2020-06-12

Today's task is to finish HDMAPMDK-1199, which I forgot about before.

Finally finished at 8 PM.

### 2020-06-13

A very leisurely day. After submitting for testing, been tinkering with my automation scripts.

Initially planned to use shell, but I really don't like shell, so started tinkering with scheme. So satisfying.

### 2020-06-15

Wow, it's 3 PM and I've been slacking off most of the day, browsing various scheme-related websites and stuff. Can't go on like this.

Need to finish HDMAPMDK-1378 today, which is something we've been reluctant to do: adding so-called lane mark direction inside intersections. But roads within intersections don't have lane marks, so how can there be lane mark direction?

Sigh, I feel so bad. After反复, worked until quite late.

### 2020-06-16

Been reviewing since arriving today. Quite a lot needs to be changed. Then I started feeling a bit消极怠工, barely managed to finish. Then Brother Kuan tested and found several more bugs.

In the afternoon, learned that Brother Xiao is leaving. I was shocked for a long time.

In the evening, tinkered with scheme, got custom library compilation and referencing working.

### 2020-06-17

Today's main work is wrapping up the previous iteration, i.e., bug fixes.

### 2020-06-18

As of today, we're finally finishing the previous iteration's tasks.

My overall feeling is very bad, mainly because the meaning of the work isn't clear. Actually, I think it can be considered almost meaningless.

So, how do I define meaning here?

The meaning of current work for me, from highest to lowest priority:

1. The ability to identify problems, to discover valuable, meaningful problems.
2. Accumulate the ability to model problems, enabling me to solve more various types of problems in the future.
3. Model problems so that solutions become possible through a one-time effort to solve the class of problems described by the model.
4. Through my efforts, solve specific, meaningful problems. Among these, solving one problem at a time is less meaningful than putting in effort to solve multiple problems of a class.
5. Maintain pleasure, the sense of achievement from solving problems, the趣味性 of the problems themselves.
6. Communication and relationships with people.
7. Salary (This is a保障, not that it's unimportant, but other parts should be built upon it.)

This might not cover all my work motivations, but it at least reflects part of the reality.

The reason I feel frustrated today, I think one main reason is the loss of趣味性. First, the meaning of the problem itself isn't clear to me, which reduces motivation. Second, the modeling of this type of problem isn't precise enough, causing the solution method to not solve all problems (of course, models that solve all problems rarely exist because models themselves are simplifications and abstractions of problems; here we discuss solving problems within an acceptable range), leading to反复. Specifically, the bugs reported one after another by QA同学. Although some are due to insufficient understanding of requirements or are the testers' own problems, the time spent analyzing the problems themselves occupies the most time-consuming part of the entire problem-solving process.

Sometimes, insufficient understanding of a problem leads to non-essential solutions, causing people to spend time on useless work. Basically, points 3, 4, and 5 of the above meaning aren't satisfied, making me frustrated.

Another point to consider: So far, I've been solving problems from the previous iteration that should have been done. Haven't started the tasks for this iteration at all. This compresses the time for this iteration and might传递 affect subsequent iterations. This is a恶性循环 that shouldn't happen. Considering it might even更深远地 affect interpersonal relationships, I think it's even more不应该.

Therefore, starting tomorrow, I should try to consider all aspects of a task before solving it.

Looking back at what I've done in the past ten days, work progress has almost completely stagnated. On that Monday when I first arrived in Beijing, June 8th, I said, `Then about work, after finishing the delivery busy period recently, mainly the TLM (typed lane model) refactoring. This time, need to clarify goals and control myself, not refactor impulsively. Need to be strategic and control my progress.`

Currently, I think a good point is that I record what I do every day, even if sometimes very brief or补充 the next day. But I believe持续地记录 is the seed of change.

Also,补充 something I read before that I think is very, very reasonable:

> A few years ago, when I bought my first house in New York, a real estate agent said something very insightful, "This house needs major repairs, a complete overhaul. This 65-year-old house has absolute升值潜力. Now you need to make a list of everything that needs fixing and get it all done within six months. You must solve everything within six months."<br>"Are you crazy? After paying the deposit, taxes, lawyer fees, I have no money left. And I'm a very disciplined person; I can fix everything slowly over five years."<br>She said, "No, you won't. Because after six months, you'll get used to the current state. You'll think everything is fine. Even if there's a corpse in the living room, you'll step over it nonchalantly."<br>I still remember these words. What surprised me was that she was right about everything. I was wrong. The things I didn't fix within six months were still not fixed five years later when I sold the house.

This is so true. Must be vigilant and careful.

### 2020-06-19

Something very important happened today. I had lunch with Liang Xiao. I need to整理一下.

### 2020-06-22

Started消极,一直在 analyzing bugs. Finally found it was a small issue with Ziliang. Left work at 9 PM.

### 2020-06-23

Unbelievable! It's 7:00 PM, and I've done nothing today.

I mean I slacked off all day, browsing various websites online. Now thinking about starting work, feeling quite guilty. Thinking about the reasons, maybe because of what happened on Friday, or maybe because the Dragon Boat Festival holiday is the day after tomorrow, so消极怠工 - - But ultimately, this is not good. Even if I decide to leave, I shouldn't neglect my duties. Should treat work seriously every day, not just putting in hours, but用心去解决问题. If leaving, even more so.

Ah, now my heart is filled with guilt.

The recent task is TLM refactoring, splitting data structures into超小型 layer data structures, a very繁杂的工作. The difficulty isn't high, but due to理念的不认同 (I don't think splitting into超小型 data structures is good design. One advantage of splitting into small data structures is flexibility and ease of modification).

### 2020-06-24

Last day before the holiday, started心安理得地划水, did a bit of the refactoring work that should be done.

### 2020-06-28

Holiday's over!

Now need to adjust my mindset, face work with the right attitude; what is the right attitude? I'll try to define it below.

Wednesday night there was a heavy rainstorm. After the rain stopped, I called Senior Sophie. The主题 was that I want to run away (quit).

She initially said not to rush, need to view my work career from a very long time span, like a person might work until 70 to retire (I strongly suspect I'll work even longer). Therefore, make all decisions with a long-term vision. Look fifteen years ahead: what will I be like in fifteen years? What do I hope to become? Then make various decisions based on that expectation. For myself, I hope the 40-year-old me becomes an engineer like Liang Xiao: rational, calm; an architect; knowledgeable; still closely关注 and confident about the latest trends; able to see the essence of trends,拆解 those不变的东西,从而去关注 those truly worth solving, valuable, difficult problems—like software complexity.

To achieve this, need to keep learning, maintain a humble attitude, **use practice to test truth**. Actually, all learning is using practice to test truth. First, we encounter a problem, then look for solutions. What are the solutions? Those so-called "truths" are necessary tools for solving problems, and practice is the only criterion for testing truth. But践行 everything has too high a cost. We must accept certain risks, learn from others' cases of using practice to test truth. The risks here are:

1. Might learn false truths.
2. Dogmatism due to insufficiently深刻 understanding of the problem.

The second point is more dangerous than the first because the first is easy to verify, while the second is a deviation in thinking. This isn't a black-and-white world, so不完全正确 (i.e., not fully reflecting truth) thoughts are dangerous because they are partially correct, making people think they are universally applicable, thus using them to solve wrong problems. Hence, many so-called "silver bullets" emerge, like FP, OOP, TDD. The pursuit of "silver bullets" won't stop, nor should it, but we should acknowledge that risks and rewards coexist.

Back to the topic with Sophie. Under冷静分析和决策, use a long-term perspective to see what the current self needs; thus, priorities emerge. Considering this together makes it easier. Then she gave some practical advice: try to detach yourself from work. Don't invest too much in it.

### 2020-06-29

Slacked off in the morning as usual (how is this usual??? This can't go on!).

Finally started doing正经事 at 2 PM. Actually, it's because I don't really agree with the recent tasks, the so-called TLM refactoring. Over the past two years, I've increasingly realized I need a first-class environment, otherwise there's no growth.

So, first complete the current tasks according to the specification, then address my own problems from other aspects.

Had a mental breakdown yesterday afternoon. Anxiety surged, started feeling very难受. From around 4-5 PM until 7 PM when I decided to leave, I almost produced nothing. During this time, I felt work lost its meaning and entered吐槽 mode. Like I told Qiaobo on Sunday, the company has problems, the team has problems. The company's problem is shouting the slogan of两条腿走路 loudly but making people看不到希望. The team's problem is the Mentor's management style being too独裁. I feel like just a tool; whenever writing code, I can only write according to his way, his design, with no autonomy. Therefore, I feel the meaning of work seems lost.加上 already decided to leave, and what I'm currently doing (TLM refactoring) is very虚无, I feel increasingly压力山大.

But no matter what, need to maintain a good mindset, do what's at hand, and set boundaries.

Discussed TLM refactoring with Mentor. Still quite troublesome, but at least there's a direction now. Can develop according to this direction.

Walked 20,000 steps with Qiaobo in Zhongguancun in the evening.

Had an interview from 1 PM to 2 PM. The guy was pretty good, I think we can add a code interview round.

Slacked off until 4 PM.

Jingzai helped me review my resume. Lots to change, but can't修改简历 openly during work hours, so I need to leave work a bit earlier and修改 at home. But this way, the time I can leave for TLM isn't much. So actually, I shouldn't slack off. Sigh, especially today's slacking was basically doing nothing, just playing on my phone! Can't go on like this.

Still have one bug and后续 work for TLM.

Today's work is to continue TLM refactoring. Honestly, the workload for this task is much larger than I imagined.

I estimate I can差不多 finish the parser today.

I plan to do a归纳汇总 after finishing Sectioning, abstract out some traits.

Had lunch with Liu Ge today.

> I believe most engineers (including myself) have a certain degree of self-ability否定倾向. Often, we need to face situations where our abilities are insufficient, yet still overcome the obstacles before us. In such cases, relying on others'成果 and "best practices" is safer. But soon, we come to think these "best practices" are well-considered or肯定适用于 our problem. Cloud vendors benefit when you enable more services. Microservices advocates make money when you buy their books. Both have incentives to sell you technology you don't need.

Someday last week.

Haven't written a daily log for a long time. I decide to break this现状.

As days pass, my压力 becomes越来越大.同时,面试和工作的事情 are almost suffocating me.
