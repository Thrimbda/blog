Well, today is the third day of the internship, and so far, it's quite different from what I had imagined.

I've previously complained about the internet and its speed here: there's no internet in the dorm at all, and the connection in the classroom is quite poor. This situation made me suddenly realize how addicted I am to the internet, though I personally don't think it's a problem. The internet can indeed serve as a "Khala" that enlightens people's minds, elevating our entire species to a highly advanced...

Getting back on track, I've been learning the Spring framework these past two days, and it feels refreshingly new. As a newcomer, I couldn't help but marvel at how elegant Java code can be.

<!--more-->

Such an exclamation reveals just how inexperienced I am. On second thought, any language can be elegant. Elegance is the crystallization of carefully designed wisdom after thorough consideration, and it doesn't seem to have much to do with the medium.

## RESTful

Currently, using the Spring framework is mainly for building web applications. Following the official tutorial, I also revisited the benefits of the RESTful architecture, which can be summarized as follows:

+ **Decoupling frontend and backend**: Since this architecture is resource-oriented, formatted text (often JSON?) rather than entire HTML pages is used as the response, allowing complete separation between frontend and backend.
+ **Clear representation**: RESTful fully leverages the characteristics of the HTTP protocol, using URIs to request resources instead of long query strings separated by `&`. This reflects the design philosophy of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) rather than treating it merely as a low-level transport protocol while messing around at the upper layer. It strictly defines CRUD operations on resources and implements them using HTTP verbs.

I've only recently emerged from the ancient mindset of web development, so my understanding might not be entirely thorough. If there are any misconceptions, please don't hesitate to correct me!

## Spring as a Web Framework

It's been exactly a year since the Java Web course project in my sophomore year, and I've encountered several web development technologies since then. I can still recall the excitement when I first deployed an application to a server and successfully accessed it from my phone :) Following curiosity and exploring unknown territories driven by it is truly a wonderful thing.

From Java's `JSP` to Python's `Django`, then to `Flask`, and finally back to Java, I encountered `Spring`.

JSP is a truly ancient technology, and using it is incredibly cumbersome, especially during later stages of development when making changes for certain features. The entire Servlet can become a massive, lengthy monster. When dealing with database connections and pagination requirements, achieving elegance with JavaBeans is almost a pipe dream. JSP pages, originally intended to demonstrate high reusability, can become unrecognizable due to various `<%if(...)%>` statements, to the point where I could write [code that made me question my own existence](czon://e6cb322b3b182b051b8952954956a7a0ddc66b439175be040b71a02a768bf512). I should probably write a separate article reflecting on these grave mistakes I've made. That said, I don't even know how to write RESTful-style web services with JSP.

Things become much clearer with Python. Whether it's the powerful capabilities of `Django` or the simplicity and clarity of `Flask`, frameworks in general seem much more straightforward compared to the most foundational, pioneering technologies. If we categorize developers into tiers—the first tier being the pioneers of technology, and the last tier being the users of applications (even if they are purely derivative developers)—I believe framework developers belong to the second tier. They summarize the development processes of commonly used technologies, extract the most frequently used, fundamental, and essential parts, and compile them into reusable components, resulting in an excellent framework. For this reason, outstanding frameworks are often derived from real-world application projects, as is the case with `Django` and `Spring`.

Ultimately, I think `Spring` is more similar to `Flask`. Both are very lightweight and impose almost no restrictions. Perhaps the developers of `Flask` drew some inspiration from `Spring`.

### Interesting Aspect—About the Symbol `@`

During my learning process, I noticed that Spring's controller routing is implemented using Java's "annotation" feature. I need to study this feature further. Coincidentally, `Flask` uses a similar form, though in Python, `@` is called a decorator—a syntactic sugar for wrapping functions. After browsing some materials, it seems this feature was indeed borrowed by Python from Java but with more complex functionality.

As someone who already appreciates `Flask`, seeing this similarity made me like `Spring` even more.

## Conclusion

In summary, my current skill level is still far from adequate, so I haven't touched on some of Spring's core features like IoC and DI. However, it has made me realize why Java, a language that seems to be aging, remains enduringly popular. It has also significantly increased my appreciation for Java.

I look forward to learning more. It's truly exciting.

Let me end with a classic log conclusion: "Today was a truly meaningful day."
