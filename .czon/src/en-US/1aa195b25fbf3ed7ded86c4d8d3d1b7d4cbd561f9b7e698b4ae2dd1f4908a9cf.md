During the pleasant and intoxicating seven-day trip to Chengdu three years ago in that summer vacation, I probably never imagined that I would return to this city in less than four years.

With what kind of mood, carrying what kind of burdens, and intending to pursue what kind of aspirations.

<!--more-->

As early as the freshman orientation, I heard that the Software School had practical training in the third year, which would take place in Kunshan or Chengdu. Time flew by, and soon during the winter vacation of my third year, I received the news that we were going to Chengdu.

The study plan for the winter vacation was never properly implemented. Up to now, I’ve only finished reading *The Mythical Man-Month*, and most of the remaining productive work time was spent on that annoying personal project, which still isn’t completely finished. It feels like I’ve fallen into the so-called "tar pit." But then again, the time wasn’t entirely wasted. Working on a project is better than playing games and regretting it later—that’s what I think.

## The Trip to Chengdu

When it comes to Chengdu, the impression it gives me as an outsider is that it’s a paradise for foodies, a leisure capital, the Land of Abundance. But I’m not a foodie, so from that perspective, Chengdu doesn’t hold much appeal for me. However, during the summer vacation after high school, I promised a classmate to travel together—doing someone a favor—so we went together. After checking flight tickets, we found that tickets to Chongqing were very cheap, so we decided to spend two days in Chongqing first and then take a high-speed train to Chengdu. Eating and drinking along the way, it felt no different from what I had imagined. I did get to witness the laid-back lifestyle of Chengdu locals. Sometimes, seeing elderly Chengdu residents strolling leisurely on the streets, my own mood would relax as well. Unfortunately, back then, my mind was elsewhere, always thinking about other things, so that trip didn’t feel real.

Now, there’s no sense of novelty left, and I haven’t attached any unrealistic expectations to this training session. The only expectation is that I can calm my mind.

Apart from almost going to the wrong train station (a place called Xi’an South Station, which I had never been to before), the journey went smoothly. The six of us arrived in this laid-back city.

Our destination was in the northwest of Chengdu, in the suburbs of Pi County. It was said to be a two-hour drive, and I fully expected it to be some desolate place. We got off the train a little after six in the morning. At the train station, an uncle followed us from the moment we exited, trying to get his first ride-hailing business of the day. We were so annoyed that we gave in to his wish—25 yuan per person for the six of us to get to our destination, which was reasonable.

**And that’s how I learned about the prowess of Chengdu drivers.**

Dozens of traffic lights, and the driver uncle, taking advantage of the still-dark sky, didn’t stop at a single one. A seven-seater business van, driving at 80 kilometers per hour the whole way without any fear—truly wilder than Xi’an’s taxi drivers.

Upon arrival, I found it much more beautiful than I had imagined. It didn’t feel like a county town at all; instead, it resembled a big city with towering buildings.

### About Jingrong Town

After living here for a few days, I found this place strange, with an eerie feeling—so few people, yet everywhere filled with entrepreneurial hype: giant banners with photos of Ma Yun, Lei Jun, Li Yanhong, and even Steve Jobs and Bill Gates hanging on the sides of tall buildings along the streets. There were even three coffee shops in one block. It all felt so serious.

So, with great curiosity, I searched on Zhihu and found these results:

- [Jingrong Town, Chengdu’s First Entrepreneurial Theme Town: Will It Become the Next Zhongguancun?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/38584390)
- [How Do You Evaluate the Current State and Future Trends of Chengdu’s Internet Industry?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/38545586)

In summary, it’s a modern town built in response to the national call for "mass entrepreneurship," rising from the remnants of Foxconn’s properties. Currently in its early stages of development, the government has equipped it with infrastructure and offers attractive incentives to attract businesses, aiming to develop it into an incubation base for entrepreneurial talent and companies. This is related to the new development policies of Chengdu’s new mayor, with the ultimate goal of becoming the next Zhongguancun, or even the next Silicon Valley.

But I also think entrepreneurship requires not only an environment but also a methodology. It shouldn’t just be about hype. As for what this place will become in the future, we’ll have to wait and see.

## New Semester, "New Atmosphere"

I thought we’d have a workspace with excellent internet speed, a comfortable environment, and individual workstations. Who knew we’d still have to attend classes, with no internet in the dormitory and poor internet speed in the classroom?

In such an environment, I perfectly missed the chance to retake Probability Theory and sign up for Software Project Management :) (just one hour late).

As for why I have one retake and one make-up exam: the former is because I slacked off during the deferred exam, didn’t study seriously, failed, and didn’t even get a chance to skip the exam; the latter is because I missed too many classes and was barred from taking the exam. But looking on the bright side, my university experience is now complete :)

Ultimately, it’s because I never know what’s on my mind all day—I just don’t pay attention to my own affairs. So, suffering losses is pretty much routine for me.

Missing the sign-up, given the increasingly strict school management these days, probably means I’ll have to wait until next semester.

Anyway, learn from mistakes and grow wiser.

## Back to the Topic

The main purpose of coming to Chengdu this time is to participate in practical training, aiming to learn some practical knowledge and develop software following standard,规范的 processes.

With my previous, not entirely successful experience in freelance work, I came here with open ears, genuinely wanting to learn something humbly.

However, according to the requirements, we can only do Java development, which means I can’t continue working on the [Orange-Juice](https://github.com/function-x/Orange-Juice) project I was collaborating on with a classmate. So, we had to regroup. My roommates insisted I stay with them, and I reluctantly set aside my regrets—after all, what does it matter what we work on? The important thing is to be serious about it.

So—clear away distractions, let past mistakes stay in the past. It’s time to calm down and focus for this month.

I heard it snowed again in Xi’an. Here in Chengdu, it rained. The air is damp, carrying a hint of chill.

I hope I can move forward quietly, step by step.
