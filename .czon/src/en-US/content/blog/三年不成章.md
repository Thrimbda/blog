> Since yesterday's snowfall, all of Xi'an has become twice as cold.
> ~~Twice as cold means you need to wear clothes twice as thick as before~~

Borrowed an image to complement the theme of this piece.
Why did I choose such a title? Because after dinner today, on my way back to the lab from Kangqiao, the scene stirred my emotions, and I felt compelled to express my thoughts.

## The Biggest Snow Since University (Maybe)

> Actually, the snow on January 31st this year was heavier.

I stayed overnight in the lab the night before last. Since the room is fully equipped with heating and air conditioning, and we almost never open the windows, it was quite warm. Only when I went out to use the restroom did I feel it was a bit colder than usual. It was dark, and I didn’t think much of it.

—It wasn’t until the next morning when I woke up shivering that I slowly realized it had snowed.
The snow fell all day, only stopping after 11 p.m.

Unfortunately, I stayed overnight in the lab to meet a noon deadline today, so I spent the entire snowy day indoors. It wasn’t until I finished my work in the evening that I decided to return to my dorm to rest for the night. The night snack vendors deserve admiration for braving such a cold night to set up their stalls, so I went to support their work.

Thus, the beautiful snow scene was ~~_wasted_~~ missed by me.

## More Interesting Than the Snow Are the Excited Southerners

> The above sentence is meant in jest.

I personally enjoy expressing reflections and often find myself moved by scenes, leading to moments of contemplation.

Last year, a classmate invited me to the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda. After the music fountain show ended, the bustling square quickly emptied. Gazing at the ancient pagoda, I felt deeply moved:
It has stood here quietly for a thousand years. In comparison, human life is truly short. ~~And as lonely as snow~~
Suddenly, a profound sense of history washed over me, and I was left in awe, savoring the flood of emotions.

We are moved by scenes likely because something resonates within us. Marco Polo, while describing the city of Phyllida to Kublai Khan, said:

> If you find one of the two arcades more pleasing, it is because thirty years ago a girl in an embroidered skirt with wide sleeves passed there, or because the light at a certain moment reminded you of another arcade somewhere else.

## Like an Audience Watching Someone Else’s Life

> I felt quite sad after returning that day. Why?

I love talking big, discussing life and ideals—it feels exhilarating!
Sitting comfortably in a café, engaging in lofty discussions and lamenting the past and present, is certainly carefree. But if, afterward, one fails to **internalize the heart and express it through action**, like the musician Shi Wen learning the qin, then it’s nothing but idleness.
I also want to echo Zhu Ziqing and say: This year I am twenty, and I am truly too clever.

**Without any accumulation, what is there to reflect upon?**
In high school, I enjoyed criticizing the country and the education system, calling them factories that mass-produce fools.
But upon second thought, being such a cynic and making such remarks doesn’t bring about the slightest change in the country or education. The only thing it achieves is venting dissatisfaction, then continuing to drift in a sea of suffering, making no progress, and becoming one of the aforementioned fools.

After recounting all the cities he had visited, Polo summarized to the Khan:

> The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together.
> There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: **seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.**

Actually, both passages above were spoken by Italo Calvino through Polo’s voice.

## The Greatness of a University Lies in Its Culture

> This is a quote from Lu Xun, as recounted by my high school chemistry teacher.

**John Henry Newman, the Bishop of Oxford and initiator of the Oxford Movement, stated in his famous lecture "The Idea of a University":**

> Gentlemen, if I had to choose between a university where students are supervised, accumulate credits, and graduate, and one without professors or exams where young people live together and learn from each other for three or four years, I would unhesitatingly choose the latter… Why? I think this way: when many intelligent, curious, compassionate, and perceptive young people gather, even without being taught, they can learn from each other. They exchange ideas, discover new perspectives, encounter fresh experiences, and develop unique judgment in behavior.

_Although Xi’an Jiaotong University follows the former system, it still shines, to some extent, with the brilliance of the latter._

After dinner, I walked out of Kangqiao and exhaled a few breaths of mist. Although the day was cold, it was mealtime, and the area outside the cafeteria was bustling, with soft music playing over the broadcast.
As I passed through the crowd, I often overheard conversations—some discussing their latest research directions, others debating a mechanics problem, and still others talking about the design of something… I felt somewhat moved and eventually realized that most of the people before me are future artists, scientists, and engineers.

Although it was the season after heavy snow, with all things withering, I witnessed an unprecedented vitality.

**How fortunate! Let me sing to express my aspirations.**

## Postscript

Having survived the deadline, I breathed a sigh of relief and wrote this piece.
