Just a few farewell dinners, a few items to pick up, and in a few days, I will truly graduate, leaving the sweet slumber of dreams to once again set foot on the soil of reality.

Just now, I was chatting with the head class monitor. We both knew in our hearts that this was probably the last chat before graduation. We talked about nothing but future prospects, ending with a phrase like a secret code. I sent it out, and he sent it back: **Be the Light of the World**.

It comes from the school anthem of Xi'an Jiaotong University.

> How splendid is our school, the flower of truth, a model for youth, the glory of the nation,
>
> The school flag flutters, growing with the sun, be the light of the world, be the light of the world.
>
> How splendid is our school, inspiring all, enlightening our wisdom, igniting our passion,
>
> Talented scholars gather, venturing far and wide, be the light of the world, be the light of the world.
>
>
>
> How splendid is our school, the fountain of spirit, the profound abode of science, the forest garden of art,
>
> Industry expands, progress knows no bounds, be the light of the world, be the light of the world.
>
> How splendid is our school, a brilliant civilization, practical learning cultivates the nation's foundation, the nation achieves revival,
>
> Vast is the universe, high the mountains and long the rivers, be the light of the world, be the light of the world.

Graduation is imminent. There are many things and people I haven't had time to deal with or bid farewell to, and I am about to be swept away by the torrent of the times—either dashed against the broader shores of fate or riding the wind and waves, forging ahead, becoming a navigator of the era. Not to mention the overused but beautiful phrase: "Our journey is to the stars and the sea." Ambition and lofty aspirations are always present, especially at this time—a time of parting, of ending, of new beginnings. This sentiment, I believe, can only be expressed by the phrase "Be the Light of the World" from the school anthem of my alma mater, which I both love and resent and am about to leave.

## Jiaotong University

> When heaven and earth interact, all things flourish; when superiors and inferiors communicate, their wills unite.

~~I've finally graduated, so I can freely use the term 'alma mater' now.~~

### Coming to Jiao Da After Failing Other Exams?

I'm not sure which senior I heard it from: "People at Xi'an Jiaotong University have a certain resentment, even to the point of 'coming to Jiao Da after failing other exams.'" This impression was very profound for me when I first entered university four years ago: even before the semester started, I glimpsed the depression of failing the Peking University entrance exam from a new classmate's QQ space, with the exact words being "**Living towards death**." This sentiment was especially palpable in student clubs and organizations—everyone was unhappy, feeling they had been shortchanged by ending up here. A future "roommate" also confided in me during a late-night talk, describing himself as a stray dog, his plans disrupted, dreams shattered, and a disgrace to his teachers!

Narrowing it down to my major: the air was even more saturated with a sense of despair. Due to low admission scores, this major became a convenient destination for transferred students. Moreover, all freshmen had the opportunity to transfer into it without cost upon registration, as an attraction. **It seemed incredibly cheap, a major even ghosts would disdain. How could those who came here not disdain themselves?** During military training, leaders from the neighboring School of Electronic and Information Engineering came to greet us. Out of 3,500 freshmen standing on the track field, 800 rose, crowding a corner until it was impassable—a spectacular scene for a moment. The School of Software, however, had only the Software Engineering department. When leaders came, only a sparse eighty or so people were there, desolate and lonely. But I was naive and didn't think about that at the time; instead, I took the chance to observe the girls I had never seen before.

The above mindset was a major commonality among students at Jiao Da and in the Software Engineering program. I might have been an exception because my classmates and I all got into university based on our own merit. Why could they 'fail with merit,' but I couldn't 'exceed expectations with merit' and joyfully arrive at university campus without any feeling of being unworthy? But I could still feel my classmates' disappointment, and I was clearly affected. Fortunately, for most people, this mindset lasted at most a year. Once we became familiar with our new base, built new friendships, and even licked our wounds enough to reclaim new dreams, past regrets and disappointments became insignificant. It was only then that we began to vaguely realize the **new mission and vision** we possessed, truly as the school anthem sings, we should "Be the Light of the World."

### The Cradle of Engineers

During freshman year, the teacher for Computer Fundamentals joked that our school was the "cradle of engineers," meaning it only cultivates engineers, not leaders. They become the backbone of society but are mostly buried in the torrent, serving as the solid foundation for the superstructure. He commented on the school motto: **"Diligence in Learning, Sincerity in Aspiration, Perseverance in Action, and Responsibility in Service."** It seemed to me he had bitterness he couldn't fully express—both admirable and frustrating. I couldn't say I disagreed, yet I sighed that students weren't taught to have lofty ambitions.

This actually fit my own characteristics quite well: **unsuited to be a leader, yet unwilling to be a mere follower, but worthy of being called an observer**. I'm not foolish, but each of the four points in the school motto was something I lacked and needed to learn. As for the rest, principles and their application needed to be savored in the details of life, not hindering forward progress. Additionally, I had a strange ability—to inadvertently say what I most wanted to say and do what I truly wanted to do. Sometimes, this stumbling approach would lead to painful bumps, but after pruning the dead branches and withered leaves, one truly becomes more spirited.

Thus, under the influence of the resentment described earlier and through my own unintentional yet sincere choices, I moved forward with unsteady steps. Looking back, the series of events in life, with their coincidences and narrow escapes, seem incredible. If I were to attend university a second time, it would be entirely different. These events include suddenly deciding at 4 AM the night before the election to abandon the student union, feeling I should devote myself to the Microsoft Student Club family I loved, where I stayed for four years; later, after lunch at Wutong Yuan, seeing the long-admired robotics team's booth and happily signing up, spending a full year with a schedule of "signing in at the team except during class time, Friday afternoons, and a ten-day holiday during New Year," which greatly improved my overall technical sense and confidence; signing up for the Microsoft Student Summer Camp during my sophomore year on a whim and meeting a respected friend, who, just before graduation, effortlessly helped arrange my current path; interning at a lab, gaining a unique early experience of graduate student life at our school and firmly deciding against postgraduate entrance exams; during that internship, taking on a freelance web development project that later left me so discouraged (note the following uses past perfect tense):

> Last September, because I was short on money, I took on a freelance job to build a website, scheduled to go live at the end of October. Little did I know it would become a veritable `Tar Pit` that I couldn't finish in an entire semester. Hence, this **Mythical Man-Month** tale emerged, serving as a lesson for my failure to humbly learn from the earnest teachings and valuable experiences of predecessors, for my arrogance, and for only understanding the principles after狼狈不堪地 writing ugly code. I also hope to use this as a summary of my personal learning life, trying to distill some insights, ultimately raising my own level a bit.

And finally, the half-year of hurriedly learning from scratch for studying abroad—something I had planned but not anticipated to be so rushed—which took a sharp turn at the critical moment [matter](http://0xc1.space/2017/12/10/%E8%A1%8C%E7%99%BE%E9%87%8C%E8%80%85%E5%8D%8A%E4%B9%9D%E5%8D%81/). I ended up sitting on my bed, writing this essay with great relish.

**The eagerness of the first year, the arduous accumulation of the second, the happiness and helplessness of the third, and the confusion and serenity of the fourth—these were the blood and fire within this cradle.**

Therefore, I don't feel discouraged about being trained as an engineer. Doesn't Google in the West also advocate "Ask the Engineer"? During the alma mater's 120th anniversary the year before last, I asked myself, "Can I be the light of the world?" A candid friend said, "Just a code farmer."

I only hope to be the kind of code farmer who cannot be easily replaced, **nurturing immortal fruits of logic from the fields of thought**.

### Drinking Water, Remembering the Source

An anecdote once happened on campus: two men fought in a classroom, prompting a boy in red in the class to slam the table and stand up: "This is Xi'an Jiaotong University, a world-class institution, and yet you are here making a scene. Do you think this is appropriate?!" It caused a sensation across the campus at the time, sparking a wave of thought...

I also recall an article that flooded my social media feed during the anniversary: "Jiaotong University ≠ Shanghai Jiaotong University." There seem to be five Jiaotong Universities nationwide with the same root: Shanghai Jiaotong University, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Southwest Jiaotong University, Beijing (Northern) Jiaotong University, and National Chiao Tung University (Hsinchu). Among them, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Xi'an Jiaotong University are most closely related, originating from the Nanyang Public School founded by the Beiyang Government in 1896. The Nanyang Public School was renamed several times, becoming Jiaotong University, then National Chiao Tung University. Finally, on its 60th anniversary, the main part of the university relocated west to the vast northwest to support development and construction, growing into Xi'an Jiaotong University. The part that remained in Shanghai operated independently for three more years, becoming today's Shanghai Jiaotong University. Due to various factors, Shanghai Jiaotong University has brought great honor and is the leader among the five sibling universities. Thus, the resounding name "Jiaotong University" has silently become equated with Shanghai Jiaotong University in the minds of scholars and the public at home and abroad. This, combined with the "coming to Jiao Da after failing other exams" mentality, ignited the self-esteem of XJTU students, who began to speak up for their beloved alma mater's unfair treatment. Even the fact that former President Jiang later only visited SJTU and not XJTU caused resentment. I share this sentiment too. A few days ago, a senior from another school saw my photo with former President Jiang and exclaimed in surprise, "President Jiang is also from Jiao Da?" thinking he had misspoken, and corrected himself: "XJTU, not Jiao Da." I stuck out my tongue at the screen.

Interestingly, all five Jiaotong Universities have an almost identical "Drinking Water, Remembering the Source" monument, with a three-dimensional school emblem on top and the characters "饮水思源" (Drink water, remember the source) engraved on it. Once we truly enter the real world's battlefield, as long as we hear someone is a fellow student or senior from a Jiaotong University, we feel an immediate kinship. Some even take the implementation of "being from Jiaotong University" literally, regardless of XJTU or SJTU, and thus go to SJTU for graduate studies. **After the jokes, heroes are not asked about their origins; everyone relies on their own abilities to get things done. Loving one's school is another matter of emotion; we just need to remember to drink water and remember the source.**

## Beautiful Dreams and Reality

> Giving this title might make it seem like I'm indulging in fantasy while ignoring reality, but that's both true and not.

As mentioned at the beginning of this article: "**Leaving the sweet slumber of dreams to once again set foot on the soil of [reality](http://0xc1.space/2018/03/08/'Tis-not-through-envy-of-thy-happy-lot/).**" Since going to Beijing for an internship in mid-January this year, I realized the preciousness of campus life. I once inwardly shouted, "Why don't I just go back to school and be a slacker before graduation?!" **In reality, internship life was novel, interesting, full of drive, and there were opportunities to suddenly realize it was already 11 PM.** What I want to say is that campus life is like a beautiful dream. Every time I return to school, it's like resuming that sweet slumber.

So, in early March, I would play games until 4 AM; in early April, sleep soundly until noon, order a box of roast duck rice, then hang around the department all afternoon, go to Kangqiao for dinner, take a bath at the hot spring浴室, and buy lemon black tea from the little black shop; in early May, on top of that, I would go to the southeast gate at night to buy卷馍, tofu凉菜, and面筋—we called it the "top of the taste"—to spend my "typical day" on campus. Even sweating on some staircase on campus felt incredibly blissful, like returning home after an age in a secluded paradise to find everything unchanged.

However, on the high-speed train back to school for my thesis defense in June, my heart was surprisingly calm. It was as if I had slept a long, beautiful sleep, with sunlight shining on the quilt, the thick sleepiness not yet dissipated, body and mind rested, floating up from the depths of the sea of sleep, opening my eyes, serene and content. Yet, beautiful as the dream was, it was ultimately a dream of deep sleep. In the dream, there were only eyes and ears, for learning and listening. Now awake, I have the strength to act. Qian,元亨利贞, the first line changes to the second and third lines, the hidden dragon emerges from the water. It is time to seek the great person and then be vigilant day and night,乾乾不息.

The novelty of the first two years of university wasn't fully savored before the latter two years flew by like a rocket. I told many of these stories to my diary, and more I didn't out of laziness. But the原始未受扰动的 environment gave me countless opportunities to make benign mistakes that wouldn't knock me out of the game and to learn knowledge to avoid mistakes, distinguishing those恶性错误 that, once made, would mean elimination with no chance for remedy. The process of making mistakes and the taste of their consequences were the most unpleasant, allowing me to deepen my impressions, lick my wounds, and learn from them. In the play *Copenhagen*, Heisenberg says: "Left, right, or think about it and die." I deeply agreed and posted it on social media to warn myself. But upon careful reflection, I realized the context for this phrase is skiing. In such a tense and thrilling sport, one can only turn left or right based on muscle memory formed from previous falls. If one thinks at that moment, the opportunity is missed, one dies, and is ruled out by fate. The key is to **constantly think, constantly fall, constantly form new muscle memory** in a缓和的环境, so that in truly险恶的环境中, one can敏捷机智地 turn left or right, enjoying the刺激与快乐 of extreme sports in the process.

I foresee that the life ahead will still be full of opportunities to make benign mistakes and moments to avoid any mistakes. The process won't be轻松愉快, but it will absolutely be引人入胜.

> Shaking off the drowsiness, I've written until dawn is almost breaking.
>
> I shouldn't write more here because the coffin isn't sealed yet, and no conclusions can be drawn,
>
> But I still want to say one thing—
>
> Be the Light of the World!
