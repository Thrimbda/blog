It follows their move to Suzhou for work and life, building a close-knit community akin to a college dorm. They weathered the pandemic together, prepared for ZL's study abroad, and in the summer of 2021, completed a crazy cycling trip around Qinghai Lake. After ZL went abroad, they were apart for three years. In the autumn of 2024, the author traveled across the ocean to reunite with ZL in the US for a road trip, rediscovering their old默契 (tacit understanding).

## (一) That Long-Haired Young Dude

> A few days ago, I went to visit ZL far away for ten days. Chatting at night brought up many things that happened over the years, so I'll just write as things come to mind.
>
> Also, this was originally four short essays I wrote on the platform, now compiled into one.

On November 14, 2019, at noon, I had just gotten my company lunch box and opened Hearthstone, ready to play Battlegrounds while eating as usual. Suddenly, a jolt of realization hit me—I remembered the task my boss, far away, had given me the day before: welcome the third member of our team, also the first intern.

"Oh no no no no, I completely forgot!" I immediately closed Hearthstone, put the lunch box on the table, and walked to the door of the small office area next door, curious about what this guy would be like.

I nervously peeked inside. Soon, my eyes met a pair of youthful ones, and then his shoulder-length hair startled me. Suppressing my expression, I planned to walk in confidently to greet ZL. He clearly guessed what I was thinking; beneath that youthful gaze emerged a sunny smile, instantly dissolving the awkwardness.

There's a very authentic Shaanxi noodle shop opposite Tsinghua University. We ended up having lunch there. The second shocking fact about ZL: his appetite was about three times that of mine, despite his slender frame.

On the way there and back, during our intermittent chatting, ZL, who had just graduated from the neighboring Forestry University, mentioned he planned to take the TOEFL and go abroad for graduate studies.

ZL was an incredibly emotionally rich young man. Fresh out of university, he was curious about everything, always ready to be inspired by anything. He was smart and pure, and didn't bind himself to any specific moral code—the kind of friend you'd be willing to discuss your xp with. To put it this way: Denji is ZL's most vivid anime counterpart.

My time in Beijing was coming to an end with some decisions. Three days later (exactly three days before today five years ago), ZL and I boarded a high-speed train to Suzhou, completely leaving Beijing and saying goodbye to our past lives. The gears of fate turned, the pendulum of time swung. And so began a legendary friendship.

## (二) Happy Days and Farewell

"Hey, ZL, we're on a business trip in Suzhou right now. If we don't stay in a hotel, the monthly business trip allowance can completely cover the rent. Then the leftover rent money can be used to go all out on decorations!"

"Holy shit, you're right!"

(Unfortunately, the business trip allowance ended a month after saying this.)

Life in Suzhou was like university. We were in the High-speed Rail New Town at the northernmost part of Suzhou, surrounded by nothing. By 9 PM every night, the streets were eerily quiet, hardly a soul in sight.
There were very few rental options near the company. Most people chose the same apartment building, a ten-minute walk from the office. This was the Momenta University dormitory.

ZL and I started trying to build a life. For instance, I truly learned how to cook. ZL also bought quite a few things. Even the outbreak of the pandemic didn't affect this; instead, it brought us closer to other colleagues. That's also when we became good friends with playground. Soon, we found ourselves often playing Super Smash Bros. together at playground's place downstairs.

Therefore, the time at mmt always brings me feelings of joy and warmth when I look back.

ZL's girlfriend of four years was studying in Canada at the time (an important reason for ZL's plan to study abroad). Before the pandemic outbreak, he went to reunite with her and brought back a bottle of ice wine for me. In the following five years, I moved a total of six times. That bottle was one of the very few things I always kept with me. At first, I just felt the timing wasn't right to open it. Later, it became intentional. No matter where I was, it was always lying in my fridge.

By the autumn of 2021, ZL set off to study abroad.

- ZL said it's fine to post his photos.
- This is that bottle of ice wine.

## (三) Wanna Go Bike Around Qinghai Lake?

In the summer of 2021, a few weeks before ZL left for school, we planned a bike trip around Qinghai Lake. The itinerary was six days and five nights, with the actual cycling around the lake taking four full days: a total of 360 kilometers, averaging 90 km per day. Even a week after returning, with my diet back to normal, I still lost 5 pounds.

I had wanted to do another crazy travel plan like this ever since one I did in the summer before starting university in 2014. Over the years, I had怂恿 (egged on) and called out to every friend around me. ZL was the only one who showed great interest and responded positively.

We started from a bike rental shop in Haiyan County (I brought my own bike, ZL rented a touring bike) and cycled clockwise along the lake.

The sky met the water in a single line, under a vast clear sky. As far as the eye could see, there was only the road stretching to the horizon. Under the expansive blue sky was an even bluer sea, beside which were large fields of rapeseed. On the road next to the fields, there were only the two of us.
For four days, the world was compressed into the rhythmic pedaling left and right. Between heaven and earth, there were only us two. Tired bodies supported endlessly energetic minds. We didn't even bother listening to music; our conversations were hard to end.

For seven years, Qinghai Lake had been expanding. A statue standing by the shore in 2014 was half submerged in water by 2021. I wondered if, in my lifetime, Qinghai Lake would reconnect to rivers and gradually become a freshwater lake. Would we come back then? Not daring to hope for another cycling trip, but at least to drink a large pot of milk tea in a tent. And then brag about how awesome it was.

Only the severe migraine from altitude sickness that lasted almost half the journey, several continuous 30-kilometer uphill climbs, occasional heavy rain, poor accommodation conditions, and the特有的 (characteristic) awkwardness of文艺小登 (pretentious young folks) in their mid-twenties could add a slight bitterness to this trip.

It's worth mentioning that the last day's ride was accompanied by continuous heavy rain and endless uphill climbs. Our 24 Snickers bars were down to 6, and we were almost sick of Red Bull. In the afternoon, I faintly felt a chill at the base of my tongue, realizing it was a bad sign. While resting 20 km from the finish line, ZL's sense of humor was still going strong, leaving behind the masterpiece "c1 peeing picture." Fortunately, a Tibetan truck driver asked if we needed help. The moment I sat in the warm, dry, air-conditioned cab, I realized how cold I was. I shivered for another ten minutes on the road.

Back in Xining, we devoured two pounds of手抓羊肉 (hand-pulled lamb). That was the last time I saw ZL before this autumn.

- We met a Hong Kong uncle with a flat tire. After helping him pump it up, he took this超帅 (super cool) photo for us.
- I retaliated by taking a picture of ZL peeing.
- The hand-pulled lamb was incredibly delicious.

## (四) Long-Awaited Reunion

When over seven hundred days of压抑的时光 (oppressive times) had crawled across the calendar, and my work life finally showed a glimmer of light, I decided to end this long self-exile. I planned to travel across the ocean at the end of September to visit ZL, whom I hadn't seen for a full three years.

I don't know when it started, but the starting point of my travels always seemed to be after the journey had begun. That is to say, there was no one or two weeks of anticipation before departure, no lying in bed at night imagining the wonderful things that would happen on this trip. There was only packing and leaving, and I was still dealing with work issues right before departure. This made the whole process too理智 (rational) and lacking in emotion. This continued until I asked for a small bottle of酒 (alcohol) on the plane. The warmth rising from my chest after drinking it dispelled this excess rationality. Only then did my anticipation for the unknown and my nervousness about reuniting with a long-unseen old friend begin to dance in my mind.

After getting off the plane and exiting the station, I spotted him. He had cut his hair short and was no longer瘦小 (slender). Now he was a壮汉 (strapping man) with just the right hair length. Seeing each other, we couldn't suppress our rising smiles as we gradually approached. The old flame was rekindled. The outdoor air was a bit crisp, and we ducked into his small car.
Soon, after the joy of reunion settled, I found that—whether due to the long separation or the necessities of life in North America—he seemed to have武装 (armed) himself with a transparent shell, keeping me and all the world's unknowns at bay. What he presented to the world was an emotionally stable, robust man. Yet, in certain moments, one could似乎 (seem to) glimpse that青涩的少年 (youthful boy) beneath this shell.
Fortunately, it was an unstable shell. In ZL's small car, the passing scenery, under the effect of time, quickly挤碎 (crushed) the shell. Within 36 hours, we were once again chatting and joking like in those years in Suzhou, and开始下头地 (started shamelessly) commenting on every girl who walked past us—except for Asian faces.

Among my many dreams of化作水流、忘于江湖 (melting into the flow, forgetting oneself in the world), one was to drive on the PCH while listening to Jaden's song "PCH." Before reaching Monterey, I mentioned this to ZL. Without a word, he found the song and put it on repeat. Under the clear sunlight, by the misty, azure sea, as the intro to "PCH" flowed out, the sea breeze took shape. We chased the constantly坍缩的地平线 (collapsing horizon), the rolling wheels continuously碾出来 (grinding out) new memories to贴补覆盖 (patch over and cover) my失落 (lost) dream.

Sometimes the sunset was ahead of us. Fatigued by jet lag, I stared at the evening glow in silence while ZL, who was driving, was also silent. Twilight and灯光 (lights) fell on our faces. Under the gaze of the黄昏的众神 (gods of dusk), we drove towards the不朽的太阳 (immortal sun), and within this silence was永不间断的谈话 (never-ending conversation). Then he broke the silence: "Tsk, gotta find a song suitable for this moment," ZL said while fiddling with the main control screen.

- P1: ZL has many strange little gadgets. After entering his house, I found a small round pair of sunglasses.
- P3: I brought that bottle of ice wine ZL gave me, which had accompanied me for five years, to the US and opened and drank it with ZL.
- P7: ZL said he really likes this photo, but it makes me look fat, which I don't really like.
- P9: Two weeks later, I stayed at ZL's place for another night during a layover in San Francisco on my way home.
