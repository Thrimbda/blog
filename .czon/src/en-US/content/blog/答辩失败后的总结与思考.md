Five hours have passed since the defense ended. I feel as if a layer of skin has been stripped away, overwhelmed by shame. Silently riding my bicycle, I blend into the sycamore-lined path. Fortunately, there are only strangers around, giving me a moment to catch my breath.

Avoidance.

This is indeed the thought I haven't had time to articulate into words. I fear any possibility of self-deception.

So I need to think: where exactly did things go wrong?

## The Defense

We included Light, the online judging platform we had been working on and which fascinated me, in our application for the major innovation project. To gain support, or perhaps to pressure ourselves, we took this step. Ah Zheng asked me to be the lead for this project, responsible for handling related matters. After hastily submitting the application, I learned that the defense was scheduled for noon today, leaving me two days to prepare.

And so, at noon today, I suffered a crushing defeat. The judges gave me the impression that they had no idea what I was talking about, thinking I was daydreaming, fabricating ideas out of thin air, and trying to pitch a nonsensical project to secure funding.

Where did the problem lie?

### External Factors

A total of eight groups defended their projects today, and I was the last. The judges were indeed not professional, even giving off a sense of condescension. But could they be blamed for this?

No. If our product is meant for the public, it must be simple enough, easy to understand and use. Therefore, if even judges in the relevant field couldn't grasp or understand it, then it must be a poorly defined product.

So, let's think further: where did the problem lie?

### Surface-Level Issues

Clearly, something was wrong with my PPT style. During the Q&A session after the defense presentation, the judges spent half their time pointing out issues with the PPT. This problem was likely the most obvious and frustrating.

This was caused by a belief I had increasingly held over recent defenses: that the PPT should outline key points, while the content should be delivered primarily through speech.

This in itself isn't a problem, but this time I fell into an almost pathological obsession: only titles, no body text, not even complete content.

Simplicity isn't the issue; the issue is shoddiness.

No data, no charts, no examples—I lacked everything that could clarify the points and make the presentation clearer.

But was it just the PPT that ruined this defense? I'm afraid it wasn't that simple.

### Communication Skills

I am well aware of my weakness: severely lacking communication skills. But do I truly understand this?

Even with a PPT like mine, proper delivery could have made the defense comprehensible.

Lack of coherence in language, gaps in logic, incomplete expressions—on top of that, I stuttered, forgot my words. All were fatal flaws.

Thus, the surface-level PPT issues exposed my shortcomings in communication.

But can these shortcomings be changed? I believe they can. However, despite knowing I had these weaknesses, I didn't take appropriate measures to prevent them from being exposed—I could have.

What else?

### Understanding of the Project

Actually, I had a similar defense experience during the Chengdu training session. The PPT back then wasn't as exaggerated as this one, and my delivery was much better. I believe the secret to that success was my role as the project manager overseeing everything: I designed the entire system in detail, understood every aspect of the API server design and the reasoning behind it, and clearly knew what kind of system I was building, who it was for, and its potential future development.

But this time was different. I felt I didn't fully understand Ah Zheng's vision for the entire system: the analysis of users' latent needs, the definition of the system, and its future, especially its developmental prospects.

### The Root Cause

Ultimately, where did the problem lie?

**Lack of genuine effort.**

If I had delved deeply into the entire project and formed my own profound understanding;

If I had rehearsed before the defense;

If my PPT had contained more substance;

This defense likely wouldn't have been such a disaster.

**In short, I feel ashamed.**

Diligence can compensate for shortcomings, not tranquility leading to distant goals. I hope I can remember this.

## Reflections

After dinner, carrying my glasses and a bottle of soy milk, I took a walk around campus and found a small garden north of the library where I could think quietly.

There, I summarized why my defense turned into a mess and pondered what a good product should look like.

### A Thought Experiment

Newton said he was merely a child picking up shells by the seashore of truth, while we are a species with an insatiable thirst for knowledge.

I believe there are two types of pioneers on the journey of exploration:

+ Creators of technology
+ Implementers of technology

The first type builds lofty foundations, worthy of remembrance and historical records, serving as the pride of their era and beacons for future history, providing possibilities for progress. The second type thinks deeply and thoroughly, connecting technology and people in a natural and harmonious way, truly realizing progress.

—Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction; Edison and Tesla created the entire electrical age.

****

Thus, I define a good product as follows:

​	**It meets a basic human need, is sufficiently convenient to use, and serves as a bridge connecting technology and humanity.**

### Returning to the Starting Point

I looked up at the towering sycamore trees. Everything has structure.

How do we abstract, model, and analyze the intrinsic connections of things? How do we see the essence beneath surface phenomena?

Human society also has structure. The depth of perspective and mastery of information resources are also ways to delineate structure. If everyone is born equal, then education provides the ladder for structural change. However, this still cannot resolve the contradictions arising from information asymmetry. For example, people at the higher levels of this structure and those at the lower levels can only communicate through media—analogous to a C/S architecture. Currently, there is no efficient method to match information seekers with providers (peer to peer).

**Perhaps Light could solve such problems? This remains to be explored.**
