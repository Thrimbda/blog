# About the New Life

-   Death Stranding, the connections between people
-   The principal contradiction
-   Love in the Time of Cholera
-   Must remember, writing this essay now is also forcing myself to organize my thoughts to face the future
-   Accompanied by my journey to view apartments, to summarize and look ahead
-   Loss of Control & Taking Control
-   Clumsiness -> just needs more practice.

## Part One
On the subway last Sunday, on my way to view an apartment, I sat in a seat by the door, hand covering my bowed head, feeling utterly miserable, like a stray dog.

This was the first time I truly felt the sensation of parting.

## Too Complete
This feeling of incompleteness is not unfamiliar. What was incomplete was my restless heart, so I was always searching, exploring, and experiencing before, which became a significant driving force in my life's journey.

For nearly the past four years, there was no sense of incompleteness, but rather a state of being at ease with myself, lazy and unrestrained.

Completeness is not about being perfect in every way. I want to reinterpret the meaning of this word: people have joys and sorrows, partings and reunions; the moon waxes and wanes. The combination of waxing and waning is the true reality. I don't believe everything **should** be complete. If there were only completeness, it would become utterly meaningless.

Apart from work, my life had gradually stagnated over this past period. We spent less and less time nurturing it. Specifically, chopsticks would be left to mold in the sink with no one having the heart to clean up. Our lives seemed to be dampened and drained of vitality within some medium, like water.

To put it bluntly, certain things in life were gradually withering away. This is the only thing I'm certain of at the moment. As for the rest of the problems, I know nothing. Being in the mountains, I only see jagged rocks, tangled roots, and unpredictable weather, while the mountain itself remains unseen.

I also don't know where this suffocating feeling comes from. Did we fail to manage things well? Was the passion bound to fade? Or were we simply not prepared? I don't know. I know it's probably a bit of everything.

## Part Two
Actually, I contacted a Ziroom apartment agent the night before, arranging to view some places near Songjiang University Town around 2:30 PM on Sunday. Songjiang is very far from Yangpu, nearly a two-hour trip. The reason I didn't go as planned wasn't just oversleeping; we also watched some TV together at noon and didn't leave until 1:30 PM. So, I informed the agent in advance that we'd reschedule, but I still set out to get a haircut.

Being overly despondent on the road isn't good for mental health. A massive dose of unfamiliar environments at once can easily trigger a stress response. Plus, since it was on the way, I spontaneously decided to go see my familiar barber for a haircut.

## Loss of Control
A person is a container, but the heart desires things beyond its capacity. When it can't hold them, that's a loss of control. What does that feeling taste like?

Clumsiness. The thought of having to clumsily pick up the threads of a solitary life for the coming period gives me a headache. I was once familiar with this life and handled it with ease. However, after four years of neglect and lack of practice, I'm no longer accustomed to it. The result is clumsiness—so clumsy that I don't even know where to begin writing this article.

Fear. Fear that my occasionally anxious heart will feel lost, restless, even silently screaming in the dim room after a nap, then be filled with a sense of emptiness, rendering me unable to do anything until I start regretting having done nothing all day.

The feeling of losing control is painful, but ultimately, it's not unfamiliar. It's like when you write an item in your work TODO list that you have no idea how to implement. Most of the time, as you gradually understand the matter better, solutions emerge, a sense of control gradually eats away at the feeling of helplessness, and your heart feels much more settled.

Mencius said: "If you seek, you will get it; if you let go, you will lose it. This seeking is beneficial for gaining, for what is sought lies within me. There is a way to seek it, but gaining it depends on fate. This seeking is not beneficial for gaining, for what is sought lies outside."

The more I ponder these words, the more profound they seem. Some things you can obtain simply by striving—straightforward, with so few variables influencing the outcome, brimming with order. Other things have methods for striving to obtain them, but no guarantee of success. Between the striving and the gaining lie countless variables, even inexplicable ones, truly a realm of chaos.

Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat all things as straw dogs. The universe bears no malice towards humans. In such an objective world, people need to manage their relationship with their own hearts, expanding their capacity as human beings amidst universal chaos. To avoid sinking into that chaos in this process, one must actively seek some sense of control. To summarize abstractly: I need to deliberately plunge into the abyss of chaos while simultaneously creating countless small universes brimming with order within it.

Such is life. Work has actually been this way for a long time.

Regretting the past is futile; knowing the future can be pursued. We will all embark on new life journeys, and time will allow the seeds we plant to grow.

## Part Three
It had been too long. Barber Jiawen and his team had moved to a new shop in Jiuting. Finally seeing a familiar face was truly a joy. My hair, grown out for over half a year, was also happy—it was finally time to shape up.

Jiawen poured me a glass of water, surprised I had become so wild-looking, then gave me a haircut like Oguri Shun's style. Because I've gained a few pounds, I ended up looking more like Gao Xiaosong. I must lose weight.

## Part Three Point Five
The feeling of losing control also comes from work.

## Part Four
I still insisted on meeting a few Lianjia agents to view apartments. Songjiang was much better than I imagined. The infrastructure was good, and it didn't seem overly noisy. The rent was also considerably cheaper than in the city center.

After viewing the apartments, I had a meal at a Shaanxi noodle restaurant with CZ. What was discouraging about this day was the feeling of losing control, but partially familiar things and expectations for the future caught me. Perhaps it's like the saying: "Leaping from the abyss, no blame."

## Plans for the Future

Not finished, to be continued.
