Today, my selected poems of Keats arrived. I bought it partly because I saw a line from *"Ode on Melancholy"* in *Sweet Bitter*: `隐藏的“忧郁”有她至尊的神龛` ("Veiled Melancholy has her sovran shrine"). Another reason is the unfinished long poem *Hyperion* and Keats himself, who runs throughout the four books of the *Hyperion* series. Having long admired it, I decided to copy down this *"Ode on Melancholy"* today. The Chinese version uses Tu An's translation.

## Ode on Melancholy

### I

```
No, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist

  Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;
     
Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kissed

  By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine;

Make not your rosary of yew-berries,

  Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be

    Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl

A partner in your sorrow's mysteries;

  For shade to shade will come to drowsily,

    And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.
```

### II

```
But when the melancholy fit shall fall

  Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud, 

That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,

  And hides the green hill in an April shroud;

Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,

  Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,

    Or on the wealth of globed peonies;

Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,

  Imprison her soft hand, and let her rave,

    And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.
```

### III

```
She dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die;

  And joy, whose hand is ever at his lips

Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,

  Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:

Aye, in the very temple of Delight

  Veiled Melancholy has her sovran shrine,

    Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue

  Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;

His soul shall taste the sadness of her might,

  And be among her cloudy trophies hung.
```

## 忧郁颂

### I

```
不呵！不要到忘川去，也不要拧绞

  根深的乌头，把它的毒汁当美酒；

别让你苍白的额头把龙葵野草——

  普罗赛嫔红葡萄的亲吻承受；

别用紫杉的坚果做你的念珠，

  别让甲虫和墓畔的飞蛾变为

    你忧伤的塞吉，别让批羽的鸱鸮

分享你心底隐秘的悲哀愁苦；

  阴影来亲近阴影会困倦嗜睡，

    会把灵魂中清醒的创痛淹没掉。
```

### II

```
但一旦忧郁的意绪突然来到，

  有如阴云洒着泪自天而降，

云雨滋润着垂头的花花草草，

  四月的雾衣把一脉青山隐藏；

你就该让哀愁痛饮早晨的玫瑰，

  或者饱餐海浪上空的虹彩，

    或者享足姹紫嫣红的牡丹；

若是你钟情的女郎娇嗔颦眉，

  就抓住她的酥手，让她说痛快，

    并深深品尝她举世无双的慧眼。
```

### III

```
她与“美”共处——那必将消亡的“美”；

  还有“喜悦”，他的手总是贴着嘴唇

说再见；令人痛苦的近邻“欣慰”，

  只要蜂蜜啜一口，就变成毒鸠：

啊，就在“快乐”的庙堂之上，

  隐藏的“忧郁”有她至尊的神龛，

    虽然，只有舌头灵、味觉良好、

  能咬破“快乐”果的人才能够瞧见：

他灵魂一旦把“忧郁”的威力品尝，

  便成为她的战利品，悬挂在云霄。
