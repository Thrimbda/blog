"title": "Some Thoughts on Structure"
"summary": "This article explores the formation of the strong and the weak in society, the ways in which system rules are established (top-down or bottom-up), and the role of personal desires in system interactions, from the perspectives of personal momentum and system rules. The author argues that individuals exert influence within systems through momentum (i.e., effort and gain), while system rules are often set by elites (the strong), with the masses (the weak) surviving under these rules. Using examples from international society and corporate organizations, the article analyzes inequality, conflicts of desire, and the importance of system selection. Ultimately, it advises individuals to understand system rules and carefully choose which systems to interact with to maximize the satisfaction of their own desires."

Here are the clues I have gathered so far:

-   I have begun to realize that everyone has their own strengths; others are not idiots.
-   Therefore, when a person racks their brains to do something, they often gain something from it. This could perhaps be called a person's momentum.
-   When a group of people operate under a system's rules, although various internal frictions may arise—such as two people striving in opposite directions, or communication and collaboration between people becoming problematic—the momentum of each individual aggregates to form the total momentum within that system.
-   So, how are the rules of a system established? I can think of only two ways: top-down or bottom-up. That is, the will of the masses and the will of the elites. This likely holds true in any organization: a family, a school class, a company, or even a nation.
-   How do the elites and masses of a system emerge? I believe this stems from the fundamental inequality between people, which can be considered a self-evident axiom within this framework. Consider an extreme example: the international society composed of the world's nations is a truly anarchic society, as there is no manager in the true sense to govern interactions between states. Yet, we still observe that there are strong and weak nations in this world. Within the anarchic societal framework, their strength and weakness follow certain basic patterns of overlapping evolution. Delving deeper, endless principles could be discussed: the development and transformation of human social systems, cultural development determined by geography, similarities and differences in the nature of cultures, the evolution of economic laws. But ultimately, from the highest level of abstraction, the observable phenomenon is that there is always a distinction between the strong and the weak. The strong set the rules, and the weak survive under the rules of the strong. There is also mutual transformation between the strong and the weak. Thus, we call the strong the elites and the weak the masses. The number of the strong is far smaller than that of the weak, and the strong extract benefits from the weak.
-   The international society formed by nations is a system. A system formed by elementary school students is also a system. Large systems can contain smaller systems. Among the strong, there are also distinctions of strength and weakness; among the weak, there are also distinctions of strength and weakness. The absolute strong design systems for the weak. Within these, the relatively weak also have distinctions of strength and weakness and interact with each other. The relatively weak, surviving within a system, often believe that system is the entire world, unaware that they are living under a system designed by others. Or, even if they realize it, they can do nothing about it.
-   People (the strong among them) actively construct systems, and people also unconsciously form systems. However, the interaction between people and systems is not one-sided; systems, in turn, influence people. People enter this absurd game with an initial position and state, constituting various additional inequalities beyond physiological inequality. These layers of inequality combine to form a person's overall inequality.
-   But people have momentum; people are subjectively active. In the process of interaction between people and between people and systems, the strength and weakness among people can transform, and systems also rise, decline, and change. This manifests as a game starting to gain popularity, with everyone beginning to play it, or a game reaching its end and being abandoned by people.
-   A person's momentum stems from their inner desires, released through their position and state within a system (intellectual level, era, country, family, influences from other people and systems encountered). The existence of inner desires in people is also a self-evident axiom in this framework—the essence of human nature, not easily summarized, but broadly meaning that people will strive with all their might to pursue immediate and long-term happiness and satisfaction.
-   A person is an aggregate of a set of desires. Desires are also divided into long-term and short-term. Some desires may detract from others. For example, a person may want to lose weight and get fit but also wants to eat delicious food in the moment; these two are somewhat contradictory. Under different systems, a person will have some desires suitable for interaction within that system and others not. Our usual judgments about whether desires are good or bad are often based on a system's worldview. However, apart from a system, desires cannot be discussed as good/bad or high/low.
-   But a person's time and energy are limited; only a small portion of desires can be satisfied at any given time. For an individual, this is an operational research problem.
-   Thus, we have depicted a dynamic worldview. Expanding it, we can apply viewpoints from "On Contradiction" for further explanation.
-   Considering that I am working a job, many annoying things come one after another. This is especially evident in so-called "big tech companies." A big company is also a system. Within this system, there are many roles. These roles interact under the system's rules. From the system's perspective, it looks like this:
    -   Workers work hard, strive to complete tasks, hoping for better performance to get promotions and raises. Here, the system sets rules dictating how workers should achieve their desires. Thus, momentum aggregates to form the system's total momentum, enabling the big company to interact within the system composed of big companies.
    -   The workers are the weak in this system. The system also has bosses and senior leaders as the strong. The weak hope to become strong, while the strong hope to remain strong and continuously extract benefits from the weak.
    -   So, who sets the rules? This stems from the unconscious actions of the workers (the weak) and the conscious actions of the bosses and senior leaders (the strong). The unconscious actions of workers and the conscious actions of bosses can be understood as outlets for venting the anomalous total momentum (akin to a reduction of the normal total momentum, similar to an individual's "low-level" desires) that aggregates under the system's rules. For example, bosses want workers to infinitely sell their physical strength and wisdom, doing their utmost to provide momentum for the system (the company). Workers, however, may not be able to bear it, leading to movements against 996. Consequently, bosses realize that perhaps not allowing overtime is a better rule.
    -   Workers rarely realize that the rules of this system may not satisfy their desires well. Ultimately, desires are often artificially created.
    -   And the company is just one of countless systems. Interactions within this system may not benefit interactions in other systems (like society or family), although bosses tend to make you believe a different story.
-   Therefore, as individuals, we have an obligation to be responsible for our own well-being, thus carefully and cautiously choosing the systems we interact with and the games we want to play. At the same time, we must also realize that some systems and games are imposed upon us. For such systems, we should understand their rules, the meaning behind the rules, and the connection between the system and ourselves. So, as a worker, my purposes for choosing to work in a big tech company are:
    -   To have enough money to interact better within society, a mandatory system.
    -   To hone my skills to interact better within broader, longer-lifecycle systems like the industry and society.
    -   Recognition from peers I respect.
    -   The joy of solving problems.
    -   A very ultimate goal is to reshape these systems to some extent according to my desires through my efforts, or even to create new systems outright.
-   Ultimately, we want to have the ability and freedom to satisfy as many of our own desires as possible under the rules of these mandatory system frameworks.
-   Therefore, I need to start from my own needs, understand the rules of the systems imposed upon us, understand the rules of the systems we are interested in, and judge to what extent interacting with these systems will satisfy our desires.
