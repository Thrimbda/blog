### 2020-06-01
Went to analyze a problem with Yiming first thing this morning, spent the whole morning on it. The result was that a previously known issue (point loss caused by interpolation in the old compiler version) led to another problem: during road snapping, it happened to be near a missing segment, resulting in a negative lane offset.

Worked until around 4 PM. After an inefficient and painful late-night session (feeling that in my current state, staying up late is almost always linked to inefficiency).

### 2020-06-02
Came in the afternoon. To get Yiming's vehicle ready, fixed some bugs and caught up with Yiming's evening vehicle deployment.

### 2020-06-03
Went to help Yiming solve the problem discovered last night first thing in the morning, which was the issue of not being able to retrieve traffic lights.

### 2020-06-04
Three things to do this morning:
1.  Data cleaning and uploading the final 0605 data.
2.  Investigating the abnormal width issue - it's because there's no lane at that location.
3.  Investigating the issue of interpolation points being assigned to the wrong lane.
4.  Re-checking.

### 2020-06-05
A tense and exciting day. Completed HDMAPMDK-1347 and HDMAPMDK-1352, and also did a major refactoring.

Learned a valuable lesson: don't make huge changes right before delivery. Without sufficient QA testing, even the most brilliant refactoring can bring risks. Also, without enough time for design review (I'm referring to myself, because sometimes while writing code, you might realize the design is wrong. However, discovering design issues during implementation is another problem—starting too early).

Monday supplement:
During this intense day of refactoring, I was almost non-stop, even lacking time to think. I could only rely on familiarity and flow state to write code with extremely high efficiency. Actually, if we disregard the principle of not doing major refactoring before delivery, I really enjoyed this state. But everything needs a goal and meaning; you can't just focus on personal enjoyment, otherwise that enjoyment becomes a low-level pleasure.

### 2020-06-08
Moved to Beijing for work on Saturday.

The feeling of returning to work in Beijing is really a bit unsettling. Everything has changed. First, I lost my workstation (Xiuyun hired an intern, and for convenience, her intern is using it). This is the most uncomfortable part of all the disappointments. It's like when I moved to Class 1 in my second year of high school, sitting in a new seat knowing no one, not wanting to talk to them. The people here seem familiar yet strange. I feel like I have few friends here, which I rationally judge to be an illusion. But the feeling of not wanting to communicate with people, wanting to find a corner to stay in, is real. And I did find a corner to stay in, next to Yuzhang. Why don't I want to communicate? I still can't figure this out. Maybe it's because I lack a proper reason? When asked why I came to Beijing and how long I'll stay, I hesitantly said for a while, a month or two. Or maybe it shows that I'm essentially still an introverted person, unwilling to trouble others, especially concerned about looking foolish in others' eyes. However, the more I write, the more I feel the second reason is more prominent and unnecessary. First, looking foolish is better than actually being foolish. Seriously seeking help from others, even if clumsily, is fine. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid when you're young. Don't be afraid anytime. All is well.

Now, about work. Finished the delivery recently, mainly the TLM (typed lane model) refactoring. This time, I need to clarify goals, control myself, not impulsively refactor, but have a strategy and control my progress.

Also, I finally got my desktop computer working. It turned out that the reason it couldn't connect to the internet before was because I changed the password. After a power outage, the network connection was completely lost. So I still need to set up the machine. This time, the goals in order of priority are:
1.  Productivity
2.  Coolness
3.  Aesthetics

Spent a long time reading Wang Yin's blog today - ongoing detox. I used to be a fanatical religious follower, unable to see the essence of things. I always thought something was the ultimate solution to all problems, but in reality, such "ultimate solutions" are rare. Most of the time, it's just religious fanaticism, like:
-   Vim vs Emacs
-   OOP vs FP
-   Go vs Rust

And so on... When I first encountered OOP, I thought OOP was invincible, capable of solving all problems. But in the end, I just wrote a bunch of similar classes; actually, having those classes or not didn't matter. What was truly useful were the functions under those classes. Later (in recent years), after encountering FP, I thought FP was the silver bullet for all problems. But after writing programs in Scala for a while, I found my productivity didn't improve much. Instead, I became less efficient due to obsessing over syntax and immutability.

### 2020-06-09
Found a bit of my rhythm. Installed Arch, and it feels even more comfortable to use than Mac?

Played a lot of Battlegrounds with Yuzhang - -

### 2020-06-10
Planned to do these things today:
1.  HDMAPMDK-1199 Make RoadMark a subclass to provide richer information.
2.  HDMAPMDK-892 Provide empirical trajectories.

If there's energy left, work on the release documentation.

Ended up completing 892.

### 2020-06-11
Reviewed HDMAPMDK-892 - Provide empirical trajectories.

Found that MDK hasn't done the corresponding adaptation. Spent this afternoon doing this adaptation.

Finished the adaptation. So tired.

Continued tinkering with my Arch, trying to record some steps of my installation process as part of automation.

### 2020-06-12
Today's task is to finish HDMAPMDK-1199. Forgot about this issue before.

Finally finished it at 8 PM.

### 2020-06-13
A very leisurely day. After submitting for testing, kept tinkering with my automation scripts.

Initially planned to use shell, but I really don't like shell, so started tinkering with Scheme. So satisfying.

### 2020-06-15
Wow, it's 3 PM and I've been slacking off for most of the day, browsing various Scheme-related websites and such. Can't go on like this.

Need to finish HDMAPMDK-1378 today, which is adding so-called lane mark direction inside intersections, something we've been reluctant to do. But roads within intersections don't have lane marks, so what lane mark direction is there?

This is really bothering me. After going back and forth, worked until quite late.

### 2020-06-16
After arriving today, spent the whole time reviewing. There were quite a few things to change, and I started feeling a bit of work avoidance. Managed to finish barely, and then Brother Kuan found several more bugs.

In the afternoon, learned that Brother Xiao is leaving. I was shocked for quite a while.

In the evening, tinkered with Scheme a bit, managed to compile and reference custom libraries.

### 2020-06-17
Today's main work is wrapping up the previous iteration, which is bug fixing.

### 2020-06-18
As of today, we're finally finishing the tasks from the previous iteration.

My overall feeling is very bad, mainly because the meaning of the work isn't clear. Actually, I think it can be considered almost meaningless.

So, how do I define meaning here?

Currently, the meaning of work for me, in order of importance from high to low, is:

1.  The ability to ask questions, to discover valuable and meaningful problems.
2.  Accumulating the ability to model problems, so that in the future, I can solve more problems of various types.
3.  Modeling a problem so that a one-time effort can solve a class of problems described by that model.
4.  Through my efforts, being able to solve specific, meaningful problems. Among these, solving one problem at a time is less meaningful than putting in effort to solve multiple problems of a class.
5.  Maintaining pleasure, the sense of achievement from solving problems, and the inherent interest of the problems themselves.
6.  Communication and relationships with people.
7.  Salary (this is a guarantee; it's not that it's unimportant, but the other parts should be built upon it).

This might not include all my work motivations, but it at least reflects part of the reality.

The reason I feel frustrated today, I think, is mainly the loss of interest. First, I find the inherent meaning of the problem itself unclear, which dampens motivation. Second, the modeling of this type of problem isn't precise enough, leading to solutions that can't solve all problems (of course, models that solve all problems rarely exist because models themselves are simplifications and abstractions of problems; here we're discussing solving problems within an acceptable range), resulting in repetition. Specifically, it's the bugs raised one after another by QA colleagues. Although some are due to insufficient understanding of requirements or are the testers' own issues, the time spent analyzing the problems themselves occupies the most time-consuming part of the entire problem-solving process.

Sometimes, insufficient understanding of a problem leads to non-essential solutions, causing people to spend time on futile work. Basically, points 3, 4, and 5 of the above meaning aren't satisfied, which makes me feel frustrated.

Another point to consider is that so far, I've only been solving problems from the previous iteration. I haven't started the tasks for this iteration at all. This will compress the time for this iteration and might even affect subsequent iterations. This is a vicious cycle that shouldn't happen. Considering it might even affect interpersonal relationships more profoundly, I think it's even more unacceptable.

Therefore, starting tomorrow, I should try to consider all aspects of a task before solving it.

Looking back at what I've done in the past ten days, in terms of work progress, it's almost completely stagnant. On that Monday when I first arrived in Beijing, June 8th, I wrote: `Now, about work. Finished the delivery recently, mainly the TLM (typed lane model) refactoring. This time, I need to clarify goals, control myself, not impulsively refactor, but have a strategy and control my progress.`

Currently, I think a good point is that I record what I do every day, although sometimes it's brief or supplemented the next day. But I believe continuous recording is the seed of change.

Also, adding a sentence I saw before that I think is very, very reasonable:

> A few years ago, when I bought my first house in New York, a real estate agent said something very insightful: "This house needs major repairs, a complete overhaul. This 65-year-old house has absolute appreciation potential. Now you need to make a list of everything that needs fixing and get it all done within six months. You must solve everything within six months."<br>"Are you crazy? After paying the deposit, taxes, and lawyer fees, I have no money left. And I'm a very disciplined person; I can fix everything slowly over five years."<br>She said, "No, you won't. Because after six months, you'll get used to the current situation. You'll think everything is fine. Even if there's a corpse in the living room, you'll step over it nonchalantly."<br>I still remember these words. What surprised me was that she was right about everything. I was wrong. The things I didn't fix within six months were still not fixed five years later when I sold the house.

This is so true. Must be vigilant and careful.

### 2020-06-19
Something important happened today. I had lunch with Liang Xiao. I need to sort this out properly.

### 2020-06-22
Started off very消极,一直在分析bug,最后发现是子良的一个小问题,晚上9点下班了 (Started off very消极, kept analyzing bugs, finally found it was a small issue from Ziliang. Left work at 9 PM.)

### 2020-06-23
Unbelievable! It's 7:00 PM now, and I haven't done anything today.

I mean I slacked off the whole day, browsing various websites online. Now that I think about starting work, I feel a bit guilty. Thinking about the reasons, maybe it's because of what happened on Friday, or maybe because the Dragon Boat Festival holiday is the day after tomorrow, so I'm消极怠工 - - But ultimately, this is not good. Even if I decide to leave, I can't neglect my duties. I should treat work seriously every day, not just putting in hours, but solving problems with heart. If I'm going to leave, I should do so even more.

Ah, now my heart is filled with guilt.

The recent task is the TLM refactoring, splitting the data structure into ultra-small layer data structures. It's a very tedious task. It's not that it's difficult, but due to disagreement with the concept (I don't think splitting into ultra-small data structures is good design. One advantage of splitting into small data structures is flexibility and ease of modification).

### 2020-06-24
The last day before the holiday. Started slacking off with peace of mind, did a bit of the refactoring work I should be doing.

### 2020-06-28
Holiday's over!

Now need to adjust my mindset and face work with the right attitude. What is the right mindset? Below, I'll try to define it.

On Wednesday night, there was a heavy rainstorm. After the rain stopped, I called Senior Sophie. The topic was that I want to run away (quit).

She initially said not to rush, need to view your work life with a very long time span. For example, a person might work until they're 70 to retire (I strongly suspect I'll work even longer). Therefore, make all decisions with a long-term vision. Look at it from a fifteen-year span. What will I be like in fifteen years? What do I hope to become? Then make various decisions based on that expectation. For myself, I hope that at 40, I become an engineer like Liang Xiao: a rational, calm person; an architect; a knowledgeable person; still closely following and having a good grasp of the latest trends; able to see the essence of trends, deconstruct those unchanging things, and thus focus on solving truly worthwhile problems, those valuable, difficult problems—like software complexity.

To achieve this, one must keep learning, maintain a humble attitude, **test truth through practice**. Actually, all learning is testing truth through practice. First, we encounter a problem, then look for solutions. What are the solutions? Those so-called "truths" are necessary tools for solving problems, and practice is the sole criterion for testing truth. But testing everything through practice is too costly. We must accept certain risks, learn from cases where others test truth through practice. The risks here are:

1.  Possibly learning false truths.
2.  Dogmatism due to insufficient understanding of the problem.

The second point is more dangerous than the first because the first is easy to verify, while the second is a deviation in thinking. This isn't a black-and-white world, so incomplete correctness (i.e., not fully reflecting truth) in thinking is dangerous because it's partially correct, making people think it's universally applicable, thus using it to solve the wrong problems. This gives rise to many so-called "silver bullets," like FP, OOP, TDD. The pursuit of "silver bullets" won't stop, nor should it, but we should acknowledge that risks and rewards coexist.

Back to the topic with Sophie. Under the premise of冷静分析和决策, use a long-term perspective to see what the current self needs; thus, priorities emerge. Considering this comprehensively makes it easier. Then she gave some practical advice: try to detach yourself from work. Don't invest too much in it.

### 2020-06-29
As usual, slacked off in the morning (How is this usual??? This can't go on!)

Finally started doing real work at 2 PM. Actually, it's because I don't really agree with the recent tasks, which is the so-called TLM refactoring. In recent years, I've increasingly realized I need a first-class environment, otherwise there's no growth.

So, first complete the current tasks according to the specification, then address my own problems from other aspects.

### 2020-06-30
My mindset collapsed yesterday afternoon. Anxiety surged, and I started feeling very uncomfortable. From around 4-5 PM until 7 PM when I decided to leave, I almost accomplished nothing. During this time, I kept feeling work had lost its meaning and started my吐槽 mode. Just like I told Qiaobo on Sunday, the company has problems, and the team has problems. The company's problem is that the口号 of "walking on two legs" is loud but makes people看不到希望, and the team's problem is that the Mentor's management style is too dictatorial. I feel like I'm just a tool; whenever I write code, I can only write it his way, according to his design, with little autonomy. Therefore, I feel like the meaning of work is lost.加上已经决定了要走,以及当前在做的事情（TLM重构）非常虚无,我就愈发地感到压力山大 (Coupled with having already decided to leave and the current task (TLM refactoring) being very虚无, I feel increasingly under pressure.)

But no matter what, need to maintain a good mindset, do the tasks at hand well, and set boundaries.

### 2020-07-01
Discussed the TLM refactoring with my Mentor. It's still quite troublesome, but at least there's a direction now. Can develop according to this direction.

Walked 20,000 steps with Qiaobo in Zhongguancun in the evening.

### 2020-07-02
Had an interview from 1 PM to 2 PM this afternoon. The young man was pretty good; I think we can add a coding round.

Slacked off until 4 PM.

Jingzai helped me review my resume. There's a lot to change, but I can't修改简历 openly during work hours, so I need to leave a bit earlier and修改简历 after getting home. But this way, the time I can leave for TLM isn't much, so actually I shouldn't slack off.唉, especially today's slacking off was basically doing nothing, just playing on my phone! Can't go on like this.

Still have one bug left and后续工作 for TLM.

### 2020-07-06
Today's work is continuing the TLM refactoring. Honestly, the workload for this task is much larger than I imagined.

I estimate I can finish the parser today.

I plan to do a round of归纳汇总 after finishing Sectioning, abstracting out some traits.

### 2020-07-07

### 2020-07-09
Had lunch with Linnan. Have an interview in the afternoon.

### 2020-07-10
Had lunch with Liu Ge today.

> I believe most engineers (including myself) have a certain degree of self-doubt regarding their abilities. Often, we need to face situations where our abilities are insufficient, yet we still have to overcome the obstacles before us. In such cases, relying on others'成果 and "best practices" is safer. But we quickly come to believe these "best practices" are well-considered or肯定适用于我们的问题. Cloud providers benefit when you enable more services. Microservices advocates make money when you buy their books. Both have an incentive to sell you technology you don't need.

### 2020-07-13
Someday last week.

### 2020-07-22
Haven't written a daily log in a long time. I've decided to break this现状.

As the days pass, my压力 is getting越来越大,同时面试和工作的事情丫的我几乎喘不过气来 (As the days pass, my压力 is getting越来越大,同时面试和工作的事情丫的我几乎喘不过气来).
