"title": "A Few Words After Setting Up the Blog"
"summary": "This article documents the author's complete process of building a personal blog over two days after the 2017 Lunar New Year. Initially dissatisfied with the limitations of platforms like Jianshu and inspired by a friend's blog, the author decided to build their own. They first manually deployed a blog using the Hexo framework and NexT theme to GitHub Pages. Seeking greater convenience, they then explored methods for automatic build and deployment using Travis CI, ultimately succeeding by following a friend's tutorial. In conclusion, the author reflects on their own learning habits through the experience of building the blog, advocating for perseverance as a fresh start for the new year."

It took me two days to set up my own blog, and now I'm brimming with thoughts, wanting to share a few points.

## The Reason Behind It

After returning home on January 25th, I joyfully celebrated the New Year.

I have this flaw: once I'm home on vacation, I absolutely cannot study. Back in high school, homework would occasionally keep me in check on weekends, but now I'm completely unrestrained. However, I couldn't just let myself mess around at home every day. While habits are hard to change, people are adaptable. So, as soon as the New Year festivities wound down after the eighth day, I escaped my own clutches and returned to school. The lab has one advantage: no matter how comfortable the environment, I can muster the willpower not to switch to Windows to play games.

Back at school, after tweaking my half-baked website, I started thinking about the personal blog I'd been eyeing for a long time. Previously, because [Jianshu](http://www.jianshu.com/) supported markdown, I eagerly registered. After writing a couple of casual essays, I still felt there were too many restrictions, too little freedom—call it nitpicking if you will. Seeing [Azheng's blog](https://zccz14.com/) thriving, I immediately felt I, Tu Yang, still had a lot to learn.

## Getting Hands-On

Actually, Azheng had written a tutorial: [*Using Hexo Elegantly*](https://zccz14.com/2016/12/30/%E4%BC%98%E9%9B%85%E5%9C%B0%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8Hexo/); it's very detailed, and following it step-by-step would have set things up quickly. But initially, I was blind and didn't see it, so I dove in with full enthusiasm to figure things out myself.

For the same reason, I decided not to write another tutorial myself. Instead, I'll simply record my **journey of thoughts**, adding links where appropriate.

First, I noticed the Hexo blog framework. After a night of research, I set up a Hexo blog, installed the NexT theme, configured it myself, deployed it to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and set up domain name resolution.

At this point, the blog was complete, and I could have stopped here. But I still felt that manually generating and publishing updates for this static blog was a bit cumbersome. I wanted to see if there was a way to make this already convenient solution even more convenient—frankly, I was being lazy, lazy as hell. ~~But then again, isn't the world propelled forward by lazy people trying to make their idleness more comfortable?~~

So, I discovered a pinned blog post by the initiator of NexT (that theme), discussing whether Travis CI's automatic build and continuous integration—a service that benefits humanity—could be used to automatically update the blog. But I had to get up early the next morning, so I first migrated two articles from my Jianshu account to fill this pretty vase and went to bed early.

Yesterday, I played all day and didn't touch this. Today, back in the lab, I continued tinkering. Suddenly, I found Azheng's tutorial on using Travis for automatic builds. It was on a whole other level, truly convincing:

> - Rapid Deployment
>
>   Leveraging Git's characteristics, keep version-controlled files small and numerous, containing only source code.
>
> - Automatic Deployment
>
>   No need to manually use `hexo deploy` for deployment. Just push the source code to GitHub, and it deploys automatically.
>
> - Installation-Free
>
>   You can write/publish blog posts even without a node.js environment, hexo CLI tools, or even Git.

Here, I contentedly finished setting up my blog.

## Brimming with Thoughts

Afterward, as the concluding remarks for this inaugural post to "inaugurate" the newly built blog, I want to use this silly-sounding term I coined an hour ago as the title for this section, expressing the little insight I've gained.

New Year, new start! This is also the first post after the Lunar New Year.

Previously, for the linear algebra exam, I frantically studied from scratch for three days. Every day, I marveled: if only I could work this hard every day in my normal life. As the saying goes, "A steed's single leap cannot cover ten paces; a nag's ten-day journey succeeds through perseverance." This is probably an example, and I'm no steed.

In fact, this should be a lifelong goal for me: perseverance.

To have hope in your heart and walk steadily forward.
