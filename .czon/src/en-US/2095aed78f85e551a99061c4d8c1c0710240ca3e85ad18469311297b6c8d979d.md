"summary": "This document details the usage of the /admin feature, designed to enable website content editing and publishing without the need for a self-hosted backend. By configuring GitHub OAuth authorization, users can edit Markdown files, automatically save drafts locally, and write content back to the GitHub repository via PR creation upon publishing. The document covers the complete steps from configuration to usage, including how to set up OAuth, connect via device flow, edit content, insert images, and publish PRs. The core value lies in providing a lightweight, backend-free content management solution."

# /admin Usage Guide (MVP)

## Goal

Without introducing a self-hosted backend:

- Edit any `content/**.md`
- Automatically save drafts to the local machine (IndexedDB)
- Write Markdown + images back to the GitHub repository upon publishing (default: create branch + PR)

## Configuration

1. Copy `static/admin/config.example.js` to `static/admin/config.js`
2. Create a GitHub OAuth App and fill in `oauthClientId`
   - Homepage URL: `https://0xc1.space/`
   - Callback URL: `https://0xc1.space/admin/` (not used for device flow, but required by the GitHub form)

> `config.js` should not contain any secrets; only `client_id` is needed here.
>
> If you want **the published site to also be able to use `/admin/` directly**, commit `static/admin/config.js` to the repo (it contains no secrets, so it's safe to make public).

## Usage

1. Open `/admin/`
2. Click "Connect (Device Flow)"
3. Follow the on-page instructions to enter the code on GitHub to complete authorization
4. Refresh the file list to load `content/**.md`
5. Edit content (drafts are automatically saved locally)
6. Insert images (they will be written to `static/images/uploads/...` upon publishing)
7. Click "Publish (PR)" to create a PR, which will trigger the site publishing workflow after merging
