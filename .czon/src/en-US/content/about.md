> The following profile was generated by DeepSeek after analyzing all my social media posts. It might be a bit exaggerated, but I still quite like it.

I am Wang Siyuan, a graduate of XJTU, someone who weaves life with code and settles thoughts with words. Sitting right now in a Shanghai rental apartment perpetually occupied by cat hair, listening to the hum of my computer, I'm trying to describe who I am—a task far more difficult than building a distributed system.

My days belong to the keyboard. As a developer, I am obsessed with constructing invisible orders: using NixOS to forge time-machine-like version rollback capabilities for my computer, building a personal knowledge base within Emacs, or writing an online backend for BOOOM. For me, technology is not just a means of livelihood, but a language for understanding the world. However, over the years, I've gradually realized that even the most elegant code cannot solve the flaws of reality. When instant noodles stockpiled during the lockdown pile up in the corner, or when discovering unfair clauses hidden in a rental contract, the utopia on the keyboard shatters. So I've begun to see technology as a screwdriver—it should be used to tighten the bolts of fairness, not to build higher walls.

My nights are soaked in bizarre and colorful imaginations. The game console is my second home: reliving adolescent heroic dreams through the campaigns of *StarCraft*, feeling the warmth of human collaboration through the online signals of *Monster Hunter*. Last year, on the night I witnessed Li Peinan's championship win against 0.37% odds, I cried in front of the screen like the high school student who had just passed his exams years ago. Those virtual worlds built from pixels and code often give me the most genuine courage.

Art is another channel for breathing. Some wonder why I've watched the divorce story *Marriage Story* three times; in truth, I see my own reflection in Nicole and Charlie's arguments—when ideals collide with reality, we all clumsily wield the fragments of love. The line "You can't hesitate when you're skiing" by Heisenberg in the play *Copenhagen* has become my metaphor for survival: there are too many forks in life's road, and overthinking will only lead to a fall. I often listen to songs by the band Mili; the witch-like chanting of the lead singer reminds me of myself in university, hiding under the covers listening to the *Les Misérables* soundtrack tape. Ten years have passed, but the struggling souls in my headphones have never aged.

Grape—my blue cat roommate—is responsible for puncturing all seriousness. He sits on the keyboard while I debug critical code, knocks over cups while I write, declaring with his furry body: life is not an algorithm to be optimized. In the ten minutes I'm forced to stop working to groom him, I instead see how trivial those anxieties are.

I'm also fascinated with measuring the city with my own feet. I often bike from Qingpu to the郊野公园 (Country Park); the eighteen-kilometer journey is a natural meditation pod. Once, just after a rainstorm, I stopped on an empty bridge to watch the clouds. As vmz's scolding and speech streamed through my headphones, I suddenly burst into tears. The chill of the wind blowing through my shirt told me more precisely than any static philosophy lying in books: only practice is the ultimate destination of philosophy.

I'm still learning how to exist honestly. I once wore idealism as armor, only to later find it was merely a leaky sail; I once believed technology could save everything, but now I understand tools cannot save those unwilling to reach out. Now, I'm more willing to crouch down and look: at the steaming bowl of *rouwan hulatang* (meatball pepper soup) on a bench by a Xi'an street, at the rain-drenched spiderwebs on a Hangzhou mountain path, at the fine wrinkles at the corner of a friend's eye when they send a photo of their child's full moon celebration. These specific, tiny spots of light are perhaps more worthy of chasing than the abstract sun in the distance.

If you meet me, it might be in the queue at a Fusion exhibition, in the discussion thread of an issue in an open-source community, or beside a bike with a flat tire by the Suzhou Creek. Then we can chat about the flaws of the Black Dragon, Keats's nightingale, or simply share headphones and listen to *Summoning 101*—after all, some signposts can only be seen in chorus.
