"title": "October 2024 Reflections While Traveling"
"summary": "This article is a letter written by the author to a friend during a trip in October 2024, primarily discussing work, personal development, and life attitudes. The author first addresses the Fountain Strategy, highlighting the need to optimize alerting and rebalancing methods, emphasizing the importance of maintaining rigor after entering the Day2 operational phase. Next, the author reflects on the current state and future of the NTNL venture, considering stable cash flow as the foundation and setting a goal to expand asset scale tenfold. To achieve this, deeper communication, continuous development of existing advantages, and a balance between instrumental and value rationality are needed. Finally, the author shares views on anxiety, believing it stems from a desire for economic and cultural capital but can be transformed into motivation through active rest."

To my friend Chen Zheng,

## Thoughts and Expectations Regarding Work in the Near Future

I feel my enthusiasm for work has recovered quite a bit. Let's spend some time later to adjust the Fountain to its ideal position. The most urgent issue I see now is the optimization of alerting and rebalancing methods.

1.  The lack of alerts makes us insensitive to risk exposure, affecting our motivation and confidence in adjusting positions and leverage to an ideal state.
2.  The inconvenience of rebalancing makes it a troublesome and undesirable task. Imagine if rebalancing were a very simple process.

In DevOps, there's a concept called DayN. Day0 refers to software design and planning, Day1 to implementation and deployment, and Day2 to ongoing maintenance and iteration. Applied to the Fountain Strategy, we have clearly entered the Day2 phase—a boring, prolonged stage in my view. However, people, including myself, often easily overlook its importance and become numb over time.

However, the recent vacation gave me some time to think and rest. Upon reflection, perfecting the Fountain should be our most serious and essential task. After ensuring the existence of risk controls and the convenience of operations for the Fountain, we can free up our hands to explore boundary-expanding ventures like Meme.

## An Overall Reflection on Our Current State and Future

My expectation for the future (similar to our March outlook but with subtle differences, and aligned with my May thoughts with some development) is that, relying on the stable operation of the Fountain, we can obtain continuous cash flow to support the expansion of other future ventures.

My assessment of our situation is this: the most critical need is stable and sufficient cash flow—the basic requirement for reproducing and maintaining our standard of living.

The next step is elevating ourselves to a higher level. My idea of this higher level is: expanding the assets we can control tenfold, reaching the tens of millions level—to achieve a certain degree of freedom. To accomplish this, we need to further develop the NTNL venture. In the thoughts I shared with you in May, I outlined several paths we've taken or considered for developing our venture, emphasizing the importance of how we allocate our energy. Now, five months later, looking back, we have completed a shift in posture—from confusion to confidence: we've entered the Web3 field, adopted a more prudent and mature approach to operating our fund, and explored ways to further monetize Yuan as a product. These three points, I believe, are our advantageous conditions. Embarking on the journey is more important than reaching the destination. We can say we have completed the crucial starting point.

How do we further develop the NTNL venture? In my view, we need to do two things:

1.  Deepen communication, enhance information acquisition, discover inspiration, and avoid working behind closed doors.
2.  Patiently and continuously grasp and develop the advantageous conditions we already have (e.g., the three mentioned above).

The second point is a matter of perception and attitude; adjusting our attitude is key. The first point is necessary but currently lacking for us.

For example, the acquisition of our current advantageous conditions stemmed from trial-and-error and serendipity over the past two years. We both feel such favorable turns come too slowly. Why is that? "Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous." Our past practices failed to balance these two aspects—we absorbed too little new knowledge while, in comparison, engaged in too much narrow-minded thinking. Additionally, there was a lot of numbness (at least on my part).

In September, we had a discussion where you suggested work should follow its natural course, not forcing oneself to work, and that happily wasting time is better than working painfully. I agree with this statement, but at the time, I felt something was missing. During that day's discussion, I couldn't precisely grasp what it was, leading you to misunderstand that I needed some pressure from you, akin to a challenge, which was not the case. Now I'd like to add: besides the instrumental rationality in daily work attitude and methods you mentioned, we need value rationality to guide our direction. This value rationality is the further development of the NTNL venture, enabling us to expand our asset scale, and thereafter, to develop a mission-driven venture. From this perspective of value rationality, we must, of course, balance our daily state, avoiding excessive anxiety and pain, while maintaining some pressure and desire that drive us to work.

## Some Other Casual Thoughts

This trip has been an excellent opportunity for me to think and clear my mind. I just mentioned anxiety. I don't know why I couldn't grasp it well before to describe it in words. Actually, the source of my anxiety is simple; it can be attributed to anxiety over insufficient capital, where anxiety and desire are two sides of the same coin:

1.  Anxiety and desire regarding economic capital: Specifically, anxiety about a potential decline in social class and anxiety stemming from insufficient confidence in ascending further.
2.  Anxiety and desire regarding cultural capital: The desire for general social recognition and the desire to know more.

Essentially, it's a longing for a certain kind of "freedom": the freedom to buy things and the freedom to experience the existence of life.

These anxieties and desires can, in fact, become fuel that drives my life. Looking at it today, it's not that I'm overly anxious daily, but rather that I just needed a vacation to think and rest (lol). In the future, I should rest more actively. How can one work well without resting well?
