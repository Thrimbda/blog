"title": "The One Who Envies Time"
"summary": "Through the perspective of the protagonist Bryan, this article delves into the complex, non-linear structure of time and its projection within the human heart. It analyzes how time influences interpersonal communication, emotional experiences, and memory, revealing Bryan's envy and inferiority stemming from temporal disparities. Ultimately, it emphasizes growth and enrichment by distinguishing between what changes and what remains constant in time. Core arguments include the web-like structure of time, the encoding relationship between the heart and language, time's effect on emotions, and how individuals can courageously face the challenges time presents."

"Drink! Plasma Egg, it is the fate of your kind!" Bryan, having just finished his shower and refilled the water for the Chixue on the floor, mustered his strength and spoke in a resonant tone.

Plasma Egg and Bryan do not share a common language; in fact, only one of them can speak. Though it sounds a bit far-fetched, what Bryan said was at least true—who doesn't need water?

## Time Is Not a Flat Line

> Time was later proven not to be one-dimensional as people once thought. Or rather, describing it as merely "one-dimensional" is insufficient to express its intricate, web-like structure.

If this secret were made public, everyone would surely think Bryan is insane.

But once the taste of truth is savored, it becomes irresistible. Even if kept as a secret, never shared with another human, enduring immense loneliness, Bryan must follow his curiosity and continue seeking evidence. After all, this truth was born in his mind, in his memories—more precisely, born from another unspeakable secret in his heart. It was a terrifying [thought experiment](<https://0xc1.space/2018/08/13/Sleeping%20to%20dream/>) that left Bryan in fear for a full six months and forty days.

### The Human Heart

Yet, phenomena related to time are also connected to the human heart. As is well known, people imprison themselves (whether intentionally or unintentionally), keeping their hearts forever hidden from the light of day. Observing another's heart is utterly impossible. We can only use language to project our hearts—from their rich, complex states—onto a straight line and hand it to another person, then pray for their genius to restore our hearts, which have been distorted by linearity.

However, there are moments when our hearts inadvertently flicker into someone else's, or vice versa. At such times, expressions appear on people's faces—most often a smile, sometimes a bittersweet happiness. Because the heart is confined within a self-designed/constructed prison, the most cruel psychological states are curiosity and shyness. Bryan deeply understands the pain of being curious about another's heart. Whether in sunshine or rain, one can only guess based on meager evidence. And shyness intensifies the pain brought by curiosity.

### The Human Heart Encoded into Language

Fortunately, most of the time, things are not painful.

Bryan sometimes tries to explain his understanding of time to others. For instance, the process by which the human heart constructs the meaning carried by another's language is not, as commonly imagined, an isolated point existing solely on a timeline. Sometimes, a person's words can suddenly become effective years later, like finally obtaining the key to a puzzle. Thus, language, combined with the effects of time, moves freely through this world. Since people cannot foresee the future, they find it difficult to perceive this effect, and even if they do, they can never describe it to another—the equation has already been introduced to too many unknowns.

For those who have long spoken a particular language, they sometimes use the same, not necessarily correct, pattern to construct and interpret the hearts hidden within language. If one suddenly switches to another language, unfamiliarity with the language itself makes one involuntarily cautious, allowing language to connect more directly to the heart. Bryan has a foreign friend with whom he once shared a campfire. Their communication often makes Bryan aware of this. However, compared to the role of language itself, the similarity of human hearts is the solid foundation of friendship.

### The Projection of Time on the Human Heart

It is precisely because of this unknowability of the future, the grasp and memory of the past, and existing at different points in the web of time that immense differences and similarities arise between people. **Therefore, Bryan envies time, or rather, envies the imprint of time on a person.** This envy is actually composed of two distinct emotions:

The first is the aforementioned curiosity—curiosity about how many linguistic riddles this person has solved in different times, curiosity about the blessings and reproaches time has bestowed upon another heart, making it exuberant, and curiosity about whether one can use the same time as a measure to experience another heart's suffering and joy, and whether one, too, can become exuberant?

This leads to the second emotion: a deep sense of inferiority. Broadly speaking, lacking the effects of time means lacking countless keys, unable to unlock the secrets left in the language of the past, and unable to powerfully form new words and new languages to encode one's heart in new forms. Narrowly speaking, due to the asynchronicity of time, the probability of influencing another heart through non-linguistic means is greatly reduced. Bryan asks himself if he is ridiculously naive—even now, I can understand a bit of this feeling of his.

In the end, Bryan decides not to be a coward. He begins to learn to distinguish between what changes and what remains constant in time, believing that time will ultimately make him exuberant as well.

### The Effect of Time on the Human Heart

Before the impartial face of time, relative effects begin to show their power: "Hidden melancholy has her sovereign shrine." This is almost the line of poetry Bryan has pondered the longest. As time passes, more and more keys become available to unlock parts of its mystery, allowing one to savor different nuances.

Bryan discovers that persistently tasting melancholy amidst joy is a manifestation of consistency. Because only within the same frame of reference does the latter emerge from nostalgia for the former. In a book Bryan recently read, this consistency spanned an astonishing fifty-three years.

However, consistency is ultimately a precious quality. More often, as time flows, the human heart changes. Simplified to the binary relative effects we speak of, this manifests as joy becoming平淡 (flat) with its increase, while melancholy diminishes over time. The most tragic scenario is when past joy turns into pain, and past melancholy loses all meaning. Bryan calls this change betrayal.

He would never allow such betrayal of himself to happen again. But with the right rhythm, balance naturally emerges, just like the eyes of a poplar tree when seen for the first time—those eyes, large and small! Without an exuberant heart, they are hard to see.

### Time Ends in Plasma Egg's Snoring

So, what exactly are the things that change in time, and what are the things that remain constant? If a friendship that once shared mutual support now seems insignificant, can it be said that the hearts existing in that period of time have died?

Or perhaps every person is reborn each day, carrying the memories of yesterday's heart, ~~using this discovery as a grand excuse for procrastination~~.

Plasma Egg ultimately accepted her fate and began to snore peacefully. Only then did Bryan realize that time had stopped.
