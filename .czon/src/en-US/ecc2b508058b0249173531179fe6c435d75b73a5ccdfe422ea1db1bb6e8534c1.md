On the day I decided to take a Gap year, I bought my first pack of cigarettes and six bottles of beer, halted everything I was working on, boarded a bus home, and prepared to spend the evening alone with myself.

For me that day, the uncertainty of the future felt distant.

## The Traveler of a Hundred Miles

To put it bluntly, this was a long-term buildup that seemed unacceptable only because I suddenly came to my senses. Thinking about this made me feel the brevity of life and envy the endless flow of the Yangtze River. In the end, I calmly swallowed it all down along with the beef and beer, leaving only the lowest line of the Qian hexagram’s six lines, which I had seen many years ago, in my mind: **First Nine: Hidden Dragon, Do Not Act**.

Looking back on my four years of confusion, I couldn’t see my own path clearly. Starting over from scratch was almost routine, yet I miraculously stayed on course, stubbornly justifying the path I had vaguely chosen long ago in an almost cruel way.

If I were to summarize it, I’d first have to explain a principle.

### A Syllogism

People never feel anxious about what they lack unknowingly. Fortunately, once knowledge is acquired, it can be said to be possessed. Thus, to some extent, we are all satisfied with our current level of intelligence.

But we generally still progress. The beautiful expectations for the future drive us to overcome the challenges of real life with all our might, sometimes even willingly seeking out difficulties. This process is often called exploration. As a result, our spiritual level gradually improves through hardship, and we never wish to return to the past.

Therefore, whether or not I reach the destination, I am grateful for the ninety miles I have already traveled.

As for a final judgment, it is impossible. The coffin is not yet closed; I still have many more hundred-mile journeys ahead. So, let the detailed stories remain in my diary.

For the remaining ten miles of this journey, I hope to summarize it with the second line of the Qian hexagram: **Second Nine: Dragon Appears in the Field, Favorable to Meet Great People**.

## The Hardest Half

In short, that night, I talked with my Master, who had always encouraged me, until dawn. In the end, I felt at peace, confident that I had chosen the path most suitable for myself. The next day, I spent a quiet and pleasant afternoon with my father, who had returned to Xi’an for a meeting. To my surprise, I found myself enjoying spending time with my parents more and more.

Moving forward, I hope to continue exploring and never lose my curiosity.
