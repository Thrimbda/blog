My collection of Keats's poems arrived today. Part of the reason I bought it was because I saw a line from *"Ode on Melancholy"* — `"Veiled Melancholy has her sovran shrine"` — in *Sweet Bitter*. Another reason is the unfinished long poem *Hyperion* and Keats himself, who permeates the entire four-book series of *The Hyperion Cantos*. Having long been captivated, I decided to transcribe this *"Ode on Melancholy"* today. The Chinese version uses Tu An's translation.

## Ode on Melancholy

### I

```
No, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist

  Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;
     
Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kissed

  By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine;

Make not your rosary of yew-berries,

  Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be

    Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl

A partner in your sorrow's mysteries;

  For shade to shade will come to drowsily,

    And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.
```

### II

```
But when the melancholy fit shall fall

  Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,

That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,

  And hides the green hill in an April shroud;

Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,

  Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,

    Or on the wealth of globed peonies;

Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,

  Imprison her soft hand, and let her rave,

    And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.
```

### III

```
She dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die;

  And joy, whose hand is ever at his lips

Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,

  Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:

Aye, in the very temple of Delight

  Veiled Melancholy has her sovran shrine,

    Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue

  Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;

His soul shall taste the sadness of her might,

  And be among her cloudy trophies hung.
```

### I

```
No, no! Do not go to Lethe, nor twist
   The deep-rooted wolfsbane for its poisonous wine;
Do not let your pale forehead receive the kiss
   Of nightshade, the ruby grape of Proserpine;
Do not make your rosary from yew-berries,
   Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be
     Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl
A partner in the mysteries of your sorrow;
   For shade approaching shade will come drowsily,
     And drown the soul's wakeful anguish.
```

### II

```
But when a fit of melancholy shall fall
   Suddenly from heaven like a weeping cloud,
That nurtures all the drooping flowers,
   And veils the green hill in an April shroud;
Then let your sorrow feast upon a morning rose,
   Or upon the rainbow over the salty sand-wave,
     Or upon the opulence of full-peony blooms;
Or if your mistress shows some rich anger,
   Seize her soft hand, let her vent,
     And feed deeply, deeply upon her peerless eyes.
```

```
She dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die;
   And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips
Bidding farewell; and aching Pleasure near,
   Turning to poison as the bee's mouth sips:
Yes, in the very temple of Delight
   Veiled Melancholy holds her sovereign shrine,
     Though seen by none save him whose strenuous tongue
   Can burst Joy's grape against his fine palate;
His soul shall taste the sadness of her might,
   And be hung among her cloudy trophies.
