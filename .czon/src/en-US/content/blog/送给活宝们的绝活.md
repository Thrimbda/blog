"summary": "This article is a dedicatory preface written by the author for their high school juniors. Through reminiscing about the learning attitudes of two high school classmates, J and Y, it reflects on the pitfalls of 'thinking without learning' and 'learning without thinking'. Drawing from personal experience, the author emphasizes the need for a balance between contemplation and practice in learning, avoiding arrogance or rigidity. The article aims to guide readers toward self-exploration rather than direct lecturing, concluding with a shared encouragement from a sentence in *The Art of War*."

**Updated on 2017-02-05:**

A few days ago, I happened to meet a senior who also attended the same university as me. During a casual chat, he asked which high school I went to. I said, "Huanghe." He exclaimed in surprise, "Then you must have been the top scorer at your school!"

Since starting university, I've been asked this question many times by local Xi'an classmates. The responses are either exclamations like the one above or simply not knowing about that high school.

Actually, I wish I could say, "I was dead last in my high school."

## Explanation of the Title

The title contains two very colloquial words: **活宝 (live treasures)** and **绝活 (special skill)**. While those who understand will understand, I still feel it's necessary to explain, which is also a matter of responsibility.

These words absolutely carry a strong personal flavor—they were catchphrases of my high school homeroom teacher, Old Cao. Having studied under Old Cao, you'd probably hear such phrases countless times over the leisurely three years. But even three years after graduation, I dare not say I have mastered his teachings. It's more like standing at the doorway, just sticking my head in to take a look. As for **what kind of door it is, and what constitutes a door**, I hope you will ponder carefully.

This piece is dedicated to all my juniors from high school.

## Self-Introduction

Due to a certain not-fully-formed professional habit, I don't want to place too many restrictions on the readers of this article. Therefore, I won't make more restrictive assumptions about you than simply being my juniors—I shouldn't be seen as your senior who is three years older, nor six years older.

With this in mind, I hope you will simply regard me as the **basic**, **person** I describe myself to be—**without any extra labels**. I hope you can clearly understand the purpose of my writing this article.

## Sima Zhao's Intentions

As for why I wrote this article, I struggled in my mind for a long time but could never find a proper justification for giving a dedicatory preface to others. We are so contradictory: how capable must a person be to have the qualification to stand at a certain height and educate others? **He neither needs such qualifications nor can he ever reach the level of having them.**

So, I simply stopped considering the issue of qualifications. I wrote because there has been an impulse hidden within me for a long time to tell a story, to share life experiences. But deep down, I feel that by telling you, I can summarize and account for (my past) self: mutual benefit, why not?

## Among Any Three People, There is Always a Teacher for Me

In high school, I considered myself an exceptionally clever person. Therefore, to this day, I have never admired someone simply because they were clever. Still, I enjoy interacting with clever people because communication is easier. **But back then, I didn't understand the difference between being clever and being young.**

In my first year of high school, there was a classmate we called J.

J's mind was extremely sharp, so much so that even I thought he was clever back then. Where there is brilliance, there is mutual appreciation. High school textbook knowledge is one-sided and full of holes (knowledge gaps), especially in physics, chemistry, and biology. On almost every page, you could find questions hinted at but not explained in the book. So, we would take these questions to the teachers' office next door every day to bother them—this is a highly commendable learning attitude. Sometimes, the teachers would think for a moment and give us the answer; other times, they would brush us off with reasons like `"This won't be on the college entrance exam."`—Looking back now, perhaps the questions we asked were indeed too tricky. But at the time, we immediately elevated it to the level of `"China's education system is a factory that produces garbage."` We were really too clever.

We quickly became inflated, J even more so. Perhaps it was indeed for this reason that now, when I recall J, all that remains is him mentioning the word `"IQ"` in every other sentence and his utterly arrogant phrase, `"A bunch of idiots."`

**This is thinking without learning.**

Indeed, I often pondered questions about the stars and the vast cosmos until midnight. My heart held the sun and moon, but I didn't understand the principle that `"A steed leaping once cannot cover ten paces; a nag traveling ten days achieves it through perseverance."` This was a pitfall I stepped into.

J's attitude clearly fell prey to the so-called `"Chinese cramming education,"` but I ultimately did not degenerate along with J.

In my second year, I switched classes and met another classmate. Let's call him Y.

Y studied extremely diligently and hard; he was a rule-following student. I don't know how late Y studied every day or whether he did nothing but study after returning home—these things I have no way of knowing. But at school, the Y I could see, apart from times like morning exercises that couldn't be used for studying, Y was always diligently and hard at work: taking notes seriously in class—without even reading them, I could guess he wrote down every word the teacher wrote on the blackboard, perhaps including typos; doing homework seriously after class—when he encountered something he didn't understand (roughly once per problem, excluding those already done), he would ask the top students in the class or the teachers, completely disregarding whether they were chatting with others or doing work that shouldn't be easily interrupted.

Y often had questions during class about something the teacher just explained: not understanding what it meant, when in fact that point had just been covered—at that moment, Y was copying the previous board notes. If you copy every single word without omission, you can never keep pace with the teacher.

I often lamented that if I had even half of Y's diligence, there would be nothing I couldn't accomplish. Yet Y himself, in my view, achieved nothing. Superficially, he appeared diligent and hardworking, but in reality, it was dull and rigid—I call it an advanced form of laziness. Apart from the part of his brain used for rote memorization, the rest probably went unused.

**This is learning without thinking.**

`"Learning without thinking leads to confusion; thinking without learning leads to peril."` We are familiar with many such sayings, understand their meanings, but are just unwilling to carefully ponder the principles they contain. Because we don't understand these principles, we all tend to lean more towards either J or Y, becoming a somewhat tragic figure. Either we are unrecognized talents, buried geniuses, or we lack internal understanding and external application, achieving nothing substantial in three years.

## Swift Horses Are Common

I hope to share my thoughts in the capacity previously agreed upon, but I am unwilling to do so in a lecturing, outline-listing manner. As mentioned before, words are the finger, and the principles contained between the lines are the bright moon. Pointing at the moon with a finger often makes people mistake the finger for the moon. **It's better to guide you to find it yourselves.**

> One who has thunder in their chest but a calm lake on their face is worthy of being appointed a supreme general.

This sentence comes from *The Art of War*. May we encourage each other with it.
