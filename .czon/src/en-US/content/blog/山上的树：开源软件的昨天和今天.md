"title": "Open Source Software: Yesterday and Today - From Idealism to Commercial Reality"
"summary": "This article uses the Bus Factor mentioned by the Doom-emacs author as a starting point to discuss the fragility of open source software, such as the Faker.js incident, and analyzes the dynamics of open source communities using Bourdieu's sociological theory. It argues that open source software has evolved from the early utopian hacker culture into a mature ecosystem embracing commercial logic, forming various business models (e.g., distributions, premium feature fees). The author views this transformation as historically inevitable, asserting that the open source spirit is not diminished but has instead fostered more robust infrastructure, making the industry less reliant on individual heroes. Finally, it emphasizes that open source software thrives on solid ground and will break the 'oracle of division of labor' to empower more people in the future."

## Prologue - The (?) Fragility of Open Source Software

Recently, Henrik Lissner, the author of doom-emacs, who had been absent for nearly half a year, spoke up in the doom-emacs Discord channel:

The gist is:

> Hi all! I've been away from the project and community for about a month, dealing with family matters. If you count the health, internet, and moving issues I had last year, it's been even longer. Worse, I didn't keep you informed (or give advance warning) about these things, and I want to apologize for that. Combined with a few failed attempts over the past months, I've started to make people worry about Doom's future and its Bus factor.
>
> To be clear: I have no intention of abandoning Doom — it's just been an unfortunate and distracted two years for me — and I hope that's behind me now.
>
> After spending a week catching up, merging PRs, and updating modules, I'll post a larger announcement on Discourse detailing the current situation, the project's direction, and how I plan to address the bus factor and communication issues going forward.
>
> In the meantime, you can find me in the #development channel; if you have any questions about the project, or have recently sent me a DM/email (and are expecting a reply), or have any PRs ready to merge or needing my attention, feel free to reach out there.

Setting aside for a moment what doom-emacs is, Henrik mentioned a very interesting term: **Bus Factor**

Wikipedia's explanation of this term is:

The Bus Factor is a measurement of the concentration of information and capability within a software project team in software development, also known by some as the "truck factor" or "lorry factor." It refers to the number of key team members whose sudden absence ("hit by a bus," referring to any reason for absence such as career or lifestyle changes, marriage/childbirth, accidental injury or death, etc.) would cause the project to descend into chaos, paralysis, and ultimately failure.

A key member is interpreted as "indispensable to the project," meaning the project information they possess (e.g., design, source code, knowledge) is not widely known or shared by many other members. In a project with a high Bus Factor, even if someone suddenly becomes unavailable, there are many other individuals who possess sufficient relevant project knowledge to take their place.

A low Bus Factor is actually a common ailment of many open source software projects. If you frequent GitHub, you'll likely have noticed many projects with high star counts being abandoned due to lack of maintenance.

The most extreme example occurred in early 2022 when Marak, the author of the well-known open source tool Faker.js, intentionally sabotaged this open source library on GitHub. He cleared all the project code and left the word "endgame" in a commit. As a result, front-end engineers around the world were puzzled to find their projects malfunctioning and displaying large chunks of garbled code when they went to work that day.

_Endgame Garbled Code_

Additionally, another library he developed, colors.js, was also affected. Both of these open source libraries are foundational pillars in front-end engineering. For instance, colors.js alone has over 20 million weekly downloads on npm (you can think of it as something almost every front-end developer uses).

Back in 2020, Marak faced the窘境 of his apartment burning down, leaving him homeless. The sponsorship he received from his open source projects was insufficient to cover his daily expenses. His life became increasingly difficult, leading to the deeply regrettable and无奈 decision he made in early 2022.

_To expand on this, there are many different perspectives on this event:_
_- Some argue that if you don't want big companies freeloading on your work, you should use copyleft licenses like GPL or even AGPL, which are 'viral,' rather than the MIT License. The MIT License grants everyone the right to use your code freely from the start. However, whether a project would have achieved its current level of influence under GPL is another matter (commercial companies typically have legal teams review open source dependencies before release to ensure there are no GPL-licensed dependencies, otherwise they'd have to open source everything)._
_- Others believe that as the project has grown, countless open source contributors have added code, making it a collective creation of the entire open source community. You don't have the right to turn everyone's hard work into shit._
_- There are also voices supporting Marak. For example, some say these parasites have been sucking our blood for too long; at least you made them feel the pain!_
_- Some also approach it from the license angle. While people did contribute code, strictly speaking regarding the license, this was Marak's personal project. The MIT License grants all rights and correspondingly absolves the author of any additional obligations. Therefore, Marak was完全 within his legal rights to do this._

There have been several other similarly惋惜 incidents. For instance, Marak, the protagonist of the Faker.js事件, mentioned Aaron Hillel Swartz, a天才 programmer who participated in the development of the original RSS, co-founded Reddit, advocated for open knowledge, and actively opposed internet piracy bills. He practiced what he preached by systematically downloading academic journals from JSTOR using a guest account provided by his institution and making them publicly accessible. U.S. federal prosecutors subsequently charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He rejected a plea deal提议 by federal prosecutors for six months in federal prison. Two days later, he was found dead in his Brooklyn, New York apartment, having died by suicide.

Looking back at history, the open source spirit and open source software are perhaps one of the most不可思议 things of our time:

On one hand, the open source software movement and the free software movement are themselves不可思议. A group of intellectuals主动拆除 their own professional moats, often acting against commercial logic to实践 the理念 of "all for one, one for all" and universal harmony. For what? Because the world should be that way, for the prosperity of society as a whole, because it's cool, and also because writing software itself brings无穷乐趣 to its authors—I remember thinking when I graduated: Wow, I can get *paid* for writing code? My life is too good!

On the other hand, factually speaking, it's no exaggeration to say that open source software underpins the entire software industry today. The software industry has been彻底 changed by open source, to the point where MIT's famous introductory computer science course, 6.001—the renowned SICP (**S**tructure and **I**nterpretation of **C**omputer **P**rograms)—has now been discontinued. Professor GJS said: "Modern software engineering has become so complex that it resembles science more than engineering, because no one needs to build large systems from scratch anymore—and very few have the ability to do so."

You might感叹 and say, for things to have turned out this way, for idealists to face such遭遇, it's truly the幻灭 of ideals!

**But is that really the case?**

## The Dynamics of Open Source Software

Idealism is good, but ideals must be rooted in reality to take root and sprout. Let's bring in Bourdieu's sociological theory of "field-capital-habitus" to better explain all this.

_[(Habitus) (Capital)] + Field = Social Practice_

Simply put, think of a socially constructed space (field)围绕 a specific theme as a kind of game, and each of us is a player.

As players, although we often feel like free agents on an experiential level, the various decisions we make daily are often based on predictable, prescribed behaviors and the attitudes of others. That is, they form a habitual strategy—a habitus—through interaction with the game itself.

Influenced by this habitus, we engage in博弈 and struggle according to the rules of the game and the strategies we adopt, based on our current position (capital), to占据 a more有利 position within this game.

The entire有机体 of the above, combining subjective and objective elements, constitutes (via my极简版 summary) Bourdieu's worldview for the social sciences.

Returning from the game metaphor to the real world, similarly, no one can act without seeking some kind of interest, and the goal of that action is most likely to increase the capital they hold.

You might wonder, if that's the case, how do we explain altruistic behaviors we see in production, practice, and daily life, the奉献精神 in fields like art and science, and the open source spirit discussed in this article?

According to Bourdieu's definition, capital is not just economic capital; it should also include symbolic capital encompassing cultural capital, scientific capital, etc. Recognizing different forms of capital, Bourdieu does not believe there exists any purely disinterested behavior in social production and practice. From a perspective类似博弈论, he认为 all human actions are出发于 a calculation of some kind of interest, aimed at seizing some form of capital—if not the economic capital we typically think of.

In different fields, different forms of capital play a dominant role. Simply put, in academia, it's scientific capital; in art and culture, it's naturally cultural capital. Different forms of capital in different fields have某种汇率, so we often see political or cultural elites leveraging their influence to acquire economic capital, and vice versa.

Here, I'd like to digress. The进步性 of Bourdieu's theory, in my view, lies in the fact that all fields are created by humans, not emergent from human society. It explains why many phenomena are the way they are, while also暗示 that seemingly entrenched ideas and social phenomena are not necessarily so. In other words, there is no purely应然的 "natural law" here, thus opening the possibility for推翻 and进步. History has not ended.

![image](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/08/27/the-end-of-the-history.jpeg)
_So you think history has ended, huh? Let me tell you now, the end of history has ended._

Returning to the topic, viewing the open source spirit through this theoretical framework can be解释为: Within the field of open source software, hackers (please note: Hackers, people who enjoy challenging problems through intelligence and creative methods, definitely not Crackers, computer criminals. The Chinese internet often混淆 the two, leading to the污名化 of the term "hacker") contribute open source code to the world in order to accumulate cultural capital such as "reputation."

This actually shares the same lineage as a gift culture often found in small hunter-gatherer groups before the advent of agricultural society. Under the abundant馈赠 of nature, social relations were supported by this gift culture. Tribal chiefs would often engage in public acts of charity. As stated in the famous hacker culture文集 *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*: Within the field of open source software, there is no scarcity of "生存必需品." Early software was freely shared. This material abundance meant that the only measure of success was reputation among peers.

But hacker culture and software did not remain confined to a small, resource-rich circle. Contrary to Professor von Neumann's预言 that "the world would need only about five computers," today, software is indeed eating the world. This is good; it说明 software plays an irreplaceably巨大 role in human production and practice. On the other hand, under the influence of capitalism, the渗透 of the software industry into other industries必然 leads to the overlapping and融合 of fields, forcing this industry to, to some extent,服从 the logic of the capitalist world. When computer technology and the software industry moved from the small-circle culture of well-off, middle-class American hackers to the entire world, becoming an indispensable part of human production and practice, the原始内核 of the open source spirit was bound to be challenged.

Therefore, open source software was势必要 evolve from its initial utopian, pastoral idyll belonging to a few technical elites to embrace the masses and开始拥抱 the capitalism and commercial logic that supports the world's 7 billion people.

Countless historical examples have shown that the transition from one mode of production to another必然 involves阵痛. But as historical materialists, we do not believe that the journey from the Athenian democracy of ancient Greek city-states to capitalism is a step backward in history. On the contrary, it represents significant进步.

## The Current State of Open Source Software and Its Typical Business Models

Since the former Microsoft绞杀 the then-star software Netscape with its infamous "Embrace, Extend, Extinguish" strategy to win the browser wars, leading to Netscape's rebirth as Mozilla Firefox (today's Firefox) and sparking the open source movement; to the successful IPO of open source vendor RedHat in 1999; to today's "Microsoft ❤️ Linux" (TODO: image); and the proliferation of startups driven by open source software, I believe it can be said that at least up to now, even after embracing the capitalist commercial logic it once "despised," the open source movement is far from failure.

![image](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/08/27/landscape.png)

However, open source software has indeed分化 into two distinct forms:

The first is the original, utopian first-generation open source software, born from hackers' own needs, written and开源 for other hackers to共建 together. Examples like Vim, Emacs, Python, Linux, and PostgreSQL, which have withstood the test of time, have become symbolic标识 of open source software, revered and celebrated.

I came into contact with Emacs because I found Notion so useful that it prompted me to审视 my own documentation tools, leading to a question: Do I really want to entrust these笔记 data that might accompany me for life to a商业公司 that, while红极一时, likely won't outlive me? I then有意地考察ed and started using Emacs' Org-mode for note-taking and task management, only to find that for me, Org-mode was leagues better than Notion. However, such需求 are relatively niche. Human需求 for software are更多 about solving current problems faster, better, and cheaper, which gave birth to the second form of open source software.

The second is the新生, commercially driven open source software (and the商业公司 behind them) that, besides实践ing the大同理念 of "all for one, one for all," treat open source as a strategic consideration and market strategy. Examples today are numerous: MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Akka, RedHat, Ubuntu, GitLab, the HashiCorp stack, etc. Today, several proven and viable business models have formed围绕 open source software. Entrepreneurs today don't even need to convince VCs familiar with open source why an open source startup can succeed. For example:

Creating distributions or solutions围绕 upstream core open source software, selling licenses or software subscription services in exchange for运维 convenience or software availability guarantees. Examples include Ubuntu and RedHat for Linux, various public cloud Kubernetes container services, and various public cloud database services (to the point where MongoDB changed its open source license to禁止商业竞争 after being白嫖).

Basic features are free and open source; advanced commercial/team features are closed-source and收费. Examples include GitLab, InfluxDB, Grafana, Envd/Modelz, and the HashiCorp Stack.

Providing consulting services围绕 complex, large-scale open source software like Linux, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and Prometheus.

The reason open source business models can work is that software source code does not equal all the knowledge围绕 that software: including the software's design philosophy, the history of its architectural evolution, and most importantly, the运维 knowledge required for stable operation. This knowledge, crucial for upper-layer applications that need to run stably on it, is often held only by core developers, forming the basic logic for commercialization.

For example, it's显然不现实 for an enterprise whose main business is not various public cloud services to build its own cloud infrastructure from scratch, starting with its own data center, instead of using public cloud services like AWS or Alibaba Cloud, just because it needs to use technologies like cloud servers, databases, and container services.

You might ask, since the businesses are different and they don't care about the source code, does it even matter if the software is open source?

In these fields, if a commercial company wants to sell its own proprietary software, say, an operating system compatible with the POSIX interface protocol, they will inevitably face this质疑: How is your software better than Linux, which has been tested for 30 years? We find that nowadays, no企业 even attempts to compete with Linux head-on. Instead, everyone only works on differentiated parts.

I feel十分兴奋 about such changes in open source software and the software industry as a whole.
Why do I say that?

## Epilogue - People's History View vs. Hero's History View

Henrik, mentioned at the beginning of the article, is undoubtedly an继承者 of that star-studded utopian era in today's world, an absolute意义上的 hero. It was Henrik's doom-emacs that gave me, a Vimer, a foothold in the world of Emacs and even provided a文档编写体验 far better than Notion's. It was Henrik who led me to discover the神奇的 NixOS,从此彻底告别 endless system configuration and painful rollbacks.

Although regarding this小小风波 of the Bus Factor, Henrik stated he would绝对不会放弃 Doom-emacs and promised to give the community an交代. Sooner or later, however, heroes will always fade. When that time comes, what should we, who follow in the footsteps of heroes, do?

![image](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/08/27/motoko.jpeg)
_The net is vast and infinite. I really like the ending where Motoko disappears into the network. The audience doesn't need Motoko as an idol, and Motoko doesn't need to束缚 herself with her own ego._

In the documentation field alone, from the繁荣社区 of emacs/org-mode, tools and startups like LogSeq (seed round $4.1M) have risen. In the shadow of Notion,明星团队 like the open-source AFFiNE (Pre-A round funding in the tens of millions of dollars) have been born.

Similar things are now层出不穷 in various fields of the software industry. And all of this is built upon the坚实基础设施 laid down by generations of open source software and idealist前辈. The giants in this industry can almost no longer轻松地垄断 an entire industry as they could twenty years ago. I believe that the further完善 of infrastructure will, in the future, break the false神谕 of社会精细化分工. Everyone will be able to freely use these tools to do something interesting.

Heroes may fade, but unlike some other tragedies in history, the people within the open source software field have not betrayed their heroes. On the contrary, they have truly changed and transformed the world along the paths开创ed by the heroes. Today, Microsoft, once the "enemy" of open source software, has become a实践者 of open source software and the open source movement.

The journey of open source software from the象牙塔 of universities to the embrace of capital is历史的必然. The ideal of the open source spirit has not磨灭 with this transformation. Instead, it has催生ed a崭新 world where people do not place all their hopes on heroes. May our ideals, like open source software, take root in坚实的土地, draw nourishment from the world's污泥,茁壮成长, and grow into towering trees.
