"summary": "Triggered by a friend's birthday, the author reflects on nine years of friendship, noting that life has more moments of confusion than smooth sailing, yet attributing past difficulties to a lack of breadth of mind. Through a story about language and life paths, the author illustrates that life is not a simple matter of choosing a path but a layered, complex landscape where one can easily lose direction. However, youth provides the opportunity to leap through experiences, summarize patterns, and ultimately reach a state of clarity—clearing the clouds to see the sun. The article emphasizes the importance of reflection, growth, and finding direction amidst confusion."

Hey, today is Little Zhang's birthday. Whenever I encounter such commemorative days, I can't help but reminisce: what was I like on this day last year? And the year before that?

Of course, for it to be interesting and meaningful, all of this must be based on the commemorative significance this day holds for me. Corresponding to Little Zhang's birthday, this means from the time I met him and started wanting to celebrate his birthday. Fortunately, we met early enough—these nine years are sufficient for me to recall many things.

First, I want to sincerely wish him a happy birthday in this little corner he cannot see. I hope my friend stays healthy and happy, isn't frightened by life's hardships, and walks his own path with a firm gaze. Reflecting on it, it seems our contact has gradually decreased since university, but that doesn't mean our relationship has drifted apart. On the contrary, I believe our bond hasn't been affected by distance. The greatness of a university lies in its culture.

I've witnessed him hesitate due to comfort in recent years, grieve over betrayal, move forward because of something on his mind, be loved for his kindness, and ultimately, because of fate, I lost two friends and gained a couple who feed me dog food (show off their affection).

People, we have few moments of smooth sailing and many of confusion. But looking back, the difficulties we once perceived were often just because our capacity wasn't broad enough yet.

**Haven't I been the same?**

## Telling a Story

Language is a marvelous ability, allowing massive amounts of information to rapidly transfer between two individuals—definitely not a copy, but a leap, then vanishing in one medium and being reborn in another—embedding eternity within every fleeting moment through words, expressions, and every possible means.

What kind of process is this?

—Leaping up, piercing through the dust and smoke, soaring past birds and beasts, leaving behind the dust and boulders, you, reading these words, finally arrive at—the moon?

To be honest, I don't know where you'll end up.

I used to think life was a network of interconnected roads. People choose their own paths, walking together if they share the same aspirations, parting ways if their ambitions differ.

Later, I realized it's not that simple. Life isn't a complete graph connecting all possible nodes, where you simply choose a seemingly reasonable path and walk it. In fact, it's layered. So many paths, as distance stretches, collapse into faint traces. In this vast, intricate directed graph, it's easy to lose your way.

Fortunately, being young enough gives a person ample time to jump and weave through these edges, summarizing patterns, creeds, and methodologies through practice.

We call this **clearing the clouds to see the sun.**
