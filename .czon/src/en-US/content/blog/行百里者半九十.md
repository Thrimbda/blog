On the day I decided to take a Gap, I bought my first pack of cigarettes and six bottles of beer, halted everything I was working on, boarded the bus home, and prepared to spend an evening with myself.

For me that day, the uncertain future felt distant.

## The Ninety-Mile Traveler

To put it bluntly, this was a long-term buildup that seemed unacceptable only because I had a sudden awakening. Thinking of this made me feel the brevity of my life and envy the endless flow of the Yangtze River. In the end, I calmly swallowed it down along with the beef and beer, leaving in my mind only the bottom line of the Qian Hexagram's six lines that I had seen many years ago: **First Nine: Hidden dragon. Do not act.**

Looking back on my four confused years, I couldn't see my own path. Starting over from scratch could be called a common occurrence, yet I still, in an almost cruel way, gave reason after reason to the path I had vaguely chosen long ago. Miraculously, I never strayed.

If I were to summarize, first I must explain a principle.

### A Syllogism

People never feel anxious about what they lack and are unaware of. Fortunately, once knowledge is known, it can be said to be possessed. Therefore, to some extent, we are all satisfied with our current level of intelligence.

But we generally still progress. The beautiful expectations for future life drive a person to exert every effort to overcome the difficulties of real life, sometimes even willingly seeking out trouble. We generally call this process exploration. Thus, our spiritual level gradually improves through hardship, and we are no longer willing to return to the past.

Therefore, whether or not I reach the destination, I am grateful for the ninety miles I have already traveled.

As for a final judgment, it is impossible. The coffin is not yet closed; I still have many more hundred-mile journeys to walk. So, let the detailed stories remain in the diary.

For the remaining ten miles of this journey, I hope to summarize it with the second line of the Qian Hexagram: **Second Nine: Dragon appearing in the field. It furthers one to see the great man.**

## Half at Ninety Miles

In short, that night I talked all night with the Master who had always encouraged me, and in the end, I peacefully confirmed that I had chosen the path most suitable for myself. The next day, I spent a quiet and pleasant afternoon with my father, who had returned to Xi'an for a meeting. I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying time with my parents more and more.

Moving forward, I hope to continue exploring and never lose my curiosity.
