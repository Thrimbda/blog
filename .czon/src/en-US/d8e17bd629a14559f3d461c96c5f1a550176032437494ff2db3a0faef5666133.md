The author first analyzes their technical advantages in the Web3 field, believing that while Web3 is less mature than traditional finance, it embodies more advanced concepts and holds bright prospects. Next, the author reviews various attempted profit-making methods, including copy-trading services, SaaS products, arbitrage, memecoin sniping, and funds, sharing subjective feelings and pointing out that resource allocation is the core issue. Finally, the author uses the example of Che Guevara to explain their understanding of a 'mission,' emphasizing that a mission is something an individual finds meaningful and feels compelled to contribute to.

**First Paragraph:**
From our perspective, we don't have a strong advantage in businesses requiring licenses or relying on channels, but we do possess technical expertise—that's the first point. Comparing Web3 to traditional finance, it is less mature but incorporates concepts and mechanisms more advanced than traditional finance. While it may not achieve full decentralization, it can likely make financial processes more transparent. Then there's timing: we are currently in a trough of the economic cycle. When the next wave of economic prosperity arrives, new technologies and concepts with structural advantages will replace or partially supplant older ones. The current prevalence of 'shitcoins' indicates it's still in a very immature stage. Overall, compared to traditional finance, it holds bright prospects and abundant opportunities, and our technical strengths can be fully leveraged. Additionally, it offers a novel form of labor organization (compared to traditional companies) or at least provides new tools for traditional corporate structures, making the digital nomad lifestyle possible, which aligns more closely with our ideal way of living.

**Second Paragraph:**
Over the past two years, we've tried various ways to make money, and I have some subjective feelings about them. I thought I'd just chat casually about it, typing on my phone as thoughts come. Some of these felt comfortable, others less so; some money felt like it was rightfully ours to earn, others not so much.

1.  **Copy-trading business:** Modeling people has always made me somewhat uncomfortable. It's not just because we haven't succeeded yet; I felt this way even when we were making money initially. Engaging in speculative strategies, perhaps the markets we operate in are too mature, giving a feeling of fishing in a vast ocean where a slight misstep can capsize the boat, leading to being swallowed as bait. Or it's like gold prospecting: you dig for a long time only to find dirt; you might hit a low-grade vein that could even cause a 'mine collapse.' There's also the chance the next swing of the pickaxe might strike a rich vein, but the feeling during the digging process is overwhelmingly lonely.
2.  **Raising funds to build and sell a SaaS product:** This is genuinely difficult. We've hit walls for over half a year. But I still believe that 'Yuan,' envisioned as everyone's investment operating system, is a great cause worth pursuing. It probably requires strategy—starting from which part and gradually expanding to others. Although we hit a wall starting with a B2B quantitative platform, I think it's worth trying some B2C experiments leveraging Web3's strong speculative atmosphere. This is something I feel can be pursued as a mission. I have a definition for 'mission,' which I can explain later—it's a very high-level concept.
3.  **Arbitrage:** We've reached a consensus that this is the money we should have been making all along. My expectation for this is to establish a stable cash flow to support our other endeavors.
4.  **Attempts like memecoin sniping or participating in 'primary markets' driven by KOL calls:** Firstly, I feel this tests human nature too much. Every time you follow a big influencer's call and engage in PvP, after experiencing it a few times (with some wins and losses, overall a slight loss), I have no doubt there are tricks and even methodologies to be summarized. But I think if it can't be automated, investing energy here is inefficient and not worthwhile. It's a money-making method that doesn't sit well with me.
5.  **Finally, running a fund:** I have a feeling that with funds, you can't rush it. There needs to be a powerful profit engine behind it to support its operation. If this engine runs well, everyone is happy; if not, everyone loses. Looking at our history, introducing a fund mechanism was perhaps premature, which consumed some of our credibility among friends (because we set expectations of quick, substantial profits for investors but didn't deliver). This itself consumed a lot of our energy, making us clumsier than we could have been. In retrospect, perhaps we shouldn't have been so hasty.

Ultimately, it really boils down to the issue of resource allocation—where we allocate our energy, choosing a direction. This is the most important meta-problem.

**Third Paragraph:**
Regarding 'mission,' I think an example can illustrate my feeling about it.
In his fourth year of university, Che Guevara didn't want to continue studying. He and an older friend hit the road, planning to ride north from Argentina on a single beat-up motorcycle (which broke down along the way). They said they wanted to see North America. Traveling through Chile, they witnessed the harsh living conditions of copper miners. They met a communist couple (communism was illegal in Chile at the time). The couple was displaced, without even a blanket at night, shivering from the cold.

> "Although the figures of this couple are becoming more and more blurred and almost disappearing, the exceptionally resolute face of the husband is unforgettable in our minds. I remember him inviting us straightforwardly: 'Come on, comrades! Let's eat together! I am also a wanderer with no fixed abode.' His few words subtly conveyed a disdain for our aimless, dependent wandering."<br>Che Guevara wrote this in his diary.

Guevara was deeply shaken by this man. They themselves were aimless, but this couple, struggling without legal status, remained so resolute.

They were medical students. Later, they went to a leper colony to care for patients. When they left, during a toast, the 24-year-old Guevara realized that people are essentially not that different, especially on the South American continent. Although divided into many countries, they share cultural roots and speak the same language.

This ultimately led him to choose his mission—a communist mission. He eventually went to Cuba and, with Fidel Castro, achieved the Cuban Revolution.

So, roughly, this sense of mission is: there is something this person is destined to do. Regardless of whether it seems useful or what purpose it serves, for this person, it is the most meaningful thing. They feel this thing must be accomplished, and they believe it will be accomplished at some point within the next hundred or thousand years. They don't care if they themselves ultimately complete it; they must contribute their part. Starting from such a future, it guides every fleeting moment of their present life. In the end, they dedicate their precious time to this mission.

It's also possible that a person never finds a mission. Such a life isn't necessarily bad, but I believe a life that has found its mission is inevitably a good life.
