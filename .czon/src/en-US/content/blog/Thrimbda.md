After nearly a month of thinking and consideration, I've decided to use a new ID: **Thrimbda**

What does it mean?

Alive and thrive.

The tail is taken from the English pronunciation of the Greek letter lambda, which represents "great wisdom appearing as foolishness."

So,

**Thrimbda**!

I wasn't satisfied with such a short post, so let me ramble a bit more.

## On Dao and Shu

To summarize, the knowledge in this world can essentially be divided into two levels: **Dao** and **Shu**.

Dao is the overview;

It is the framework;

It is having a well-thought-out plan.

Shu, on the other hand, is the detail;

It is the implementation;

It is the clever tricks and techniques.

As for me,

I can't clearly see my own Dao,

Yet I've put a lot of effort into Shu.

How much of it has been in vain!
