## Hello

I've finally mustered some interest to revamp my long-neglected blog.

As of 2024, I'm at a stage in life where the urge to express can be quickly and easily satisfied offline. Although there are often many things I'd like to write about, spending time on articles feels a bit like a luxury to me. That's why I've been too lazy to maintain my blog. Coincidentally, the CI for Hexo broke down, so I took this opportunity to switch to something new.

And that's here.

After briefly looking into NextJS, Gatsby, and Hexo, and to avoid wasting this sudden urge to tinker with the blog, I ultimately chose the single-binary static site generator Zola. I didn't do any in-depth research, but it does meet my current needs:

1. Write in Markdown.
2. As long as this binary exists, I can still deploy via CI ten years from now, without build failures due to outdated dependencies (looking at you, Hexo).
3. The theme is simple enough that I can easily maintain it.

Maybe in the future, if I have time to tinker, I'll try to create a more flexible and flashy blog. But for now, this will do.

Looking back at an article I wrote years ago when I first set up my blog, I found it quite interesting, so I'll leave it here.

> After returning to school, I made some changes to my half-dead website and started thinking about the personal blog I've been eyeing for a long time. I once eagerly registered on JianShu because it supported Markdown. After writing a couple of casual essays, I still felt it was too restrictive and not free enough—call it nitpicking if you will. Seeing A-Zheng's blog[^1] thriving, I immediately felt that I, Tu Yang, still have a lot to learn.

## Footnotes

[^1]: A-Zheng said, "Who keeps a diary? Only boring people do!" Although his blog link is no longer active, he's lazy enough that he hasn't deleted the source code. So if you're interested, you can still take a look: [zccz14's Blog](https://github.com/zccz14/blog/tree/master/src/posts), though that might change once he sees this article.
