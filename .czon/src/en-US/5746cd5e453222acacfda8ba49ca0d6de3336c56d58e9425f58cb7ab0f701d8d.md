> Since yesterday's snow, all of Xi'an has become twice as cold.
> ~~Twice as cold means you need to wear clothes twice as thick as before~~

Borrowed an image to complement the theme of this piece.
Why did I choose such a title? Because on my way back to the lab from Kangqiao after dinner today, the scene stirred my emotions, and I felt compelled to express my thoughts.

## The Biggest Snow Since University (Or Not)

> Actually, the snow on January 31st this year was heavier.

I stayed overnight in the lab the night before last. Since the room is equipped with heating and air conditioning, and we almost never open the windows, it was quite warm. Only when I went out to use the restroom did I notice it was a bit colder than usual. It was dark, so I didn’t think much of it.

—It wasn’t until I woke up shivering the next morning that I slowly realized it had snowed.
The snow lasted all day, only stopping around 11 p.m.

Unfortunately, I stayed overnight in the lab to meet a noon deadline today, so I spent the entire snowy day indoors. It wasn’t until I finished my work in the evening that I decided to return to my dorm for a night’s rest. The night snack vendors deserve praise for their dedication, braving the cold night to set up their stalls. I decided to support their efforts.

Thus, I ~~_wasted_~~ missed the beautiful snowscape.

## More Interesting Than the Snow Are the Excited Southerners

> The above line is meant in jest.

I often enjoy expressing my reflections, easily stirred by the scenery to muse and ponder.

Last year, a classmate invited me to the Big Wild Goose Pagoda. After the music fountain show ended, the bustling square quickly emptied. Gazing at the ancient pagoda, I felt deeply moved:
It has stood here quietly for a thousand years. In comparison, life is truly short. ~~And as lonely as snow.~~
A sense of historical weight washed over me, and I was left in awe, savoring the flood of emotions.

We are moved by scenes because something resonates within us. Marco Polo, describing the city of Phyllis to Kublai Khan, said:

> If you feel one of the two arcades is more pleasant, it’s because thirty years ago a girl in an embroidered skirt and wide sleeves passed there, or because the light in that arcade at a certain moment reminded you of another arcade somewhere else.

## Like an Audience Watching Someone Else’s Life

> I felt quite sad after returning that day. Why?

I love talking big, discussing life and ideals—it’s exhilarating!
Sitting comfortably in a café, pontificating about the past and present, is certainly carefree. But if, afterward, we don’t **internalize and apply** it like Shi Wen learning the qin, then it’s just idle talk.
I’d like to echo Zhu Ziqing and say: This year, I’m twenty, and I’m really too clever.

**Without any accumulation, what is there to reflect on?**
In high school, I enjoyed criticizing the country and the education system, calling them factories that mass-produce fools.
But upon second thought, being such a cynic doesn’t change the country or education in the slightest. The only thing it achieves is venting dissatisfaction, then continuing to drift in a sea of suffering, making no progress, and becoming one of the aforementioned fools.

After recounting all the cities he had visited, Polo summarized to the Khan:

> The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together.
> There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: **seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.**

Actually, both passages above were spoken by Italo Calvino through Polo’s voice.

## The Greatness of a University Lies in Its Culture

> This is a quote from Lu Xun, as my high school chemistry teacher once said.

**John Henry Newman, the Bishop of Oxford and initiator of the Oxford Movement, said in his famous lecture “The Idea of a University”:**

> Gentlemen, if I had to choose between a university where students are supervised, earn credits, and graduate, and one without professors or exams where young people live together and learn from each other for three or four years, I would unhesitatingly choose the latter… Why? I think this way: When many intelligent, curious, empathetic, and perceptive young people gather, even without being taught, they can learn from each other. They exchange ideas, discover new perspectives, encounter fresh experiences, and develop unique judgment.

_Although Xi’an Jiaotong University follows the former system, it still shines with the brilliance of the latter._

After dinner, I stepped out of Kangqiao and exhaled a few breaths of mist. Though the day was cold, it was mealtime, and the area outside the cafeteria was bustling, with soft music playing over the speakers.
As I walked through the crowd, I overheard snippets of conversation—some discussing their latest research, others debating a mechanics problem, and still others talking about a design project… I felt a touch of emotion, realizing that most of the people before me were future artists, scientists, and engineers.

Despite being a season of withering after heavy snow, I witnessed an unprecedented vitality.

**How fortunate! Let me sing to express my aspirations.**

## Postscript

Having survived the deadline, I breathed a sigh of relief and wrote this piece.
