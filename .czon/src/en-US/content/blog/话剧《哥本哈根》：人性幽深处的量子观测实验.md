"title": "The Play 'Copenhagen': A Quantum Observation Experiment in the Depths of Human Nature"
"summary": "This article centers on the play 'Copenhagen,' which uses the historical enigma of the 1941 meeting between Heisenberg and Bohr in Copenhagen as its backdrop to explore the complex motivations and uncertainties within human nature. The author argues that, compared to the historical truth itself, the behavioral motivations of individuals in a superposition of multiple identities hold greater research value. The article provides a detailed analysis of how the play, through the soulful dialogue of its three protagonists, conducts a quantum experiment concerning ethics, morality, and humanity on the stage of war, knowledge, and interpersonal relationships. The author shares their personal experience of watching the play, quotes lines from it, and elaborates on how quantum mechanics repositions humanity at the center of the universe and the unknowability of the human psyche's depths. Finally, the author reflects on the meaning of writing, emphasizing that the intensity of life lies in constantly challenging oneself and extracting the marrow from experience, rather than pursuing perfection."

## The Mystery of Copenhagen

_History may become increasingly elusive as more historical materials emerge; we should focus on the invariants within human nature beneath the surface._

In 1941, German scientist Werner Heisenberg traveled to Copenhagen, Denmark, which was then occupied by Germany, to visit his former teacher, Niels Bohr. However, this reunion after four years ended quite unpleasantly and abruptly, completely severing their nearly two-decade-long deep friendship and, perhaps, forever altering the fate of the world.

This is the famous "Mystery of the Copenhagen Meeting."

For decades, people have debated the truth of this event. After the declassification of relevant archives post-Cold War and the release of more firsthand materials from Heisenberg, Bohr, and scientists from various countries associated with them, it has become possible to ascertain roughly what happened during this meeting and what Heisenberg said to Bohr that caused Bohr's fury and their ultimate parting of ways.

> "The conversation took place during an evening walk. I knew that Bohr was under surveillance by the German authorities, so I tried to conduct the conversation in a way that would not endanger myself. The conversation probably began with my question: '**Is it right for physicists to devote themselves to uranium fission research during wartime?**' because progress in this field could lead to serious consequences for the war.
> Bohr immediately understood the meaning of the question, and he looked somewhat frightened. I remember he asked in return: 'Do you really think uranium fission can be used to make weapons?' I probably answered: 'In principle, it is possible, but it requires tremendous technical effort, and we can only hope that it cannot be achieved during this war.'
> Bohr was shocked by my answer, apparently thinking I was conveying a message that Germany had made great progress in developing atomic weapons. Although I later tried to correct this mistaken impression, I probably did not win Bohr's complete trust, especially since I only dared to speak cautiously (which was absolutely my mistake) because I feared certain words might be used against me later. I was very dissatisfied with the outcome of this conversation."

> "I am thinking particularly of our conversation in the institute. In that conversation, the topic of 'war' came up, and I clearly remember every word we said.
> You began by saying that you were convinced that if the war lasted long enough, it would be decided by atomic weapons, which made a deep impression on me. At that time, I knew nothing about the preparations underway in America. Just as I was somewhat skeptical, you added that I should understand one thing: you had been almost entirely preoccupied with this problem in recent years and had no doubt that it could be solved.
> Therefore, I cannot understand at all your statement that 'you had hinted to me that German physicists would do everything to prevent the application of atomic technology.' In this brief exchange, I was very cautious and thought a great deal."
>
> _Bohr wrote this letter to Heisenberg on his 60th birthday in 1961 but never sent it. The letter was finally made public in 2002._

Historians of natural science generally believe that the outcome of the conversation likely had a profound impact on the direction of atomic bomb development and deployment by the two major warring factions during World War II, the nuclear threats facing the world today, and the future development of science and human survival.

However, the declassification of historical materials did not solve the core mystery: **Why** did Heisenberg go to Copenhagen? What was his **motivation**?

In my view, compared to the uncertain historical truth, the uncertainty of human behavior and motivation caused by the superposition of multiple identities holds greater research value. After all, history is a mirror. What we, as observers and the figures in the mirror, can see in it, what we can feel, what kind of perception of the real world we form, and how we use this perception to interact with the real world in turn—this is the most exquisite and fascinating value of this mirror for us.

## 'Copenhagen' as a Play

_A profound discussion of the antinomies arising from the complexity of human nature and the limitations of the human mind._

To explore the chaotic uncertainty in the depths of human nature—the intricate and complex **motivations** of humans—in the play 'Copenhagen,' the three protagonists: Heisenberg, Bohr, and Bohr's wife Margrethe appear on stage in the form of souls in a void world. Driven by their obsession with the truth of this mystery, they reenact that fateful meeting in the afterlife, unraveling the threads amidst the complex and contradictory superposition of identities and the uncertainty of human nature.

![theme](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/06/18/theme.jpg)

Why are "motivations" complex?

Because the real world is complex, containing an overwhelming amount of information, and participants interact within a collective unconscious. History is complex, evolving amidst countless contradictions, with chance and necessity intertwined. We cannot, in a mechanistic materialist way, separate history, the people who constitute it, the environment that shaped these people, their decisions and thoughts, and their relationships with each other, hoping to divide and conquer to obtain any meaningful answers.

The structure itself contains a vast amount of information, so much so that when the various parts of a whole organically combine, countless unexpected new phenomena emerge.

Fortunately, humans are naturally fascinated by complex information that exceeds our processing capacity. Using complex reality as raw material, 'Copenhagen' constructs its unique stage; by isolating and discussing various issues related to human nature in reality, 'Copenhagen' conducts an exquisite quantum experiment on human nature.

It highly condenses and extracts the most heart-wrenching and conflict-ridden parts of real history as its solid stage foundation:

First, war, the most devastating war in human history, divides the three protagonists into opposing camps. Then, knowledge is involved; the grand edifice of theory had just been built, and due to the discovery of nuclear fission, the development of nuclear weapons became possible, raising suffocating moral challenges. Finally, human connections tie everything together—father and son, teacher and disciple—placing the relationship between Heisenberg and Bohr, who were at the very eye of the storm, at the center, constructing its most simple yet magnificent stage.

Upon this grand and solid stage foundation, the three vivid protagonists make their entrance. With extreme care and caution, their lives, values, achievements, and emotions are restored in the work. With the experimental conditions ready, the most crucial energy element is added—Heisenberg's mysterious motivation for going to Copenhagen initiates this breathtaking experiment. Maintaining a scientific attitude during the experiment, allowing contradictions to develop freely, and letting the intense collisions of the participants produce dazzling sparks. In this process, using lines that are casual, everyday, intense, or gentle, it profoundly discusses topics such as ethics, morality, human nature, and fate, ultimately presenting the audience with an unparalleled masterpiece overflowing with information.

## The Quantum Laws in the Depths of Human Nature

_As the old saying goes, "There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's eyes."_

The role of good literary and artistic works is not to state a fact or provide specific solutions to certain problems. In my view, their value and significance lie precisely in using a poetic, ambiguous imagery to reach the human soul, allowing people to gain some kind of revelation. And this revelation is also like a mirror; everyone can observe different things—discussions on ethics and morality; critiques of reality; inquiries into human nature; or emotional resonance, a knowing smile, trembling tears, fear, anxiety, anger, warmth, fascination... It seems like an infinite source of energy, adding many colors and a bit more substance to the course of our lives.

In the summer of 2018, the company where I was interning was located in Wudaokou. I had just graduated from university, like a blank sheet of paper; dragged by a fellow intern senior to Peking University to watch this graduate performance of 'Copenhagen.' Since then, this play, resonating with real-life experiences, has echoed in my mind like a chain reaction, growing increasingly intense.

_This photo even has me in it_

For me, that poetic revelation began with the following lines:

While reviewing the establishment of the "Copenhagen Interpretation," Bohr says to Heisenberg:

---

> **Bohr** It works, yes. But it’s more important than that. Because you see what we did in those three years, Heisenberg? Not to exaggerate, but we turned the world inside out! Yes, listen, now it comes, now it comes .… We put man back at the centre of the universe. Throughout history we keep finding ourselves displaced. We keep exiling ourselves to the periphery of things. First we turn ourselves into a mere adjunct of God’s unknowable purposes, tiny figures kneeling in the great cathedral of creation. And no sooner have we recovered ourselves in the Renaissance, no sooner has man become, as Protagoras proclaimed him, the measure of all things, than we’re pushed aside again by the products of our own reasoning! We’re dwarfed again as physicists build the great new cathedrals for us to wonder at—the laws of classical mechanics that predate us from the beginning of eternity,that will survive us to eternity’s end, that exist whether we exist or not. Until we come to the beginning of the twentieth century, and we’re suddenly forced to rise from our knees again.
>
> **Heisenberg** It starts with Einstein.
>
> **Bohr** It starts with Einstein. He shows that measurement—measurement, on which the whole possibility of science depends—measurement is not an impersonal event that occurs with impartial universality. It’s a human act, carried out from a specific point of view in time and space, from the one particular viewpoint of a possible observer. Then, here in Copenhagen in those three years in the mid-twenties we discover that there is no precisely determinable objective universe. That the universe exists only as a series of approximations. Only within the limits determined by our relationship with it. Only through the understanding lodged inside the human head.

Are we the masters of all things?

> If people measured themselves by strictly discernible quantities... then we would need a novel quantum ethics.

The chaos and complexity inherent in us, the masters, lead to the fact that people do not always understand each other. Even we ourselves are sometimes unknowable to ourselves. So we are always searching, trying to unravel the mysteries left in the past.

> We are still searching when our lives end.

The world will not end with humanity.

> Everything was spared, very likely, precisely because of that brief moment in Copenhagen, that event which can never be located or defined, that ultimate kernel of uncertainty at the heart of things.

## Afterword

Like many poems I love, I devoured this play whole. Then, at certain moments in life, it always sparks into my mind in fragments. I begin to savor, chew, and ponder it, absorbing some wisdom, or at least gaining a bit of pleasure.

But is that enough?

For years, I have had the impulse to write this article. But one day in 2019, after typing the title on my computer and staring blankly for several hours, I almost trembled and gave up. What depth, wisdom, and breadth must a person possess to write a review of this play that is not self-humiliating? I was too young; I had none of these things. I was not worthy of writing it.

But is it okay to retreat with such an attitude? And then expect to continue recklessly, devouring all sorts of good things without seeking deep understanding, wasting precious gifts, all the way until I'm 90, hoping for a sudden enlightenment to turn the rotten into the miraculous?

No, that is a waste of life. It makes the taste of everything too bland. A life too bland is not worth living.

> Verse, Fame, and Beauty are intense indeed.
> But Death's intenser -- Death is Life's high meed.

So before death, live as intensely as possible. But what is 'intense'?

It is the rich aroma of life;
It is the radiance of human nature;
Perhaps it is the Olympic spirit, challenging oneself and pushing limits;
It is making oneself a bridge, a path toward the Übermensch;
It is the tree on the mountain, rooting into the darkest depths, growing toward the highest sky, and then waiting for the thunder.

Thus, we welcome the highest reward of our lives, and death thereby becomes intense.

Life is servitude; death is rest. Only an intense life deserves an even more intense death.

Today, compared to the depth, wisdom, and breadth needed to write that **perfect** review, I am still destitute, young, and shallow. But perhaps what matters is not "perfection," but the determination to extract the marrow from experience. Perhaps it is precisely each act of extracting the marrow that can increase a person's depth, wisdom, and breadth. Perhaps only in this way does life become more intense.
