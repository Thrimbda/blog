> The following introduction was generated by DeepSeek after analyzing all my social media posts. It might be a bit exaggerated, but I still quite like it.

I am Wang Siyuan, a graduate of XJTU, someone who weaves life with code and settles thoughts with words. Sitting in a Shanghai rental apartment perpetually occupied by cat fur, listening to the hum of my PC, I'm trying to describe who I am—a task far more difficult than writing a distributed system.

My days belong to the keyboard. As a developer, I'm obsessed with constructing invisible orders: using NixOS to forge time-machine-like version rollback capabilities for my computer, building a personal knowledge base within Emacs, or writing an online backend for BOOOM. For me, technology is not just a means of livelihood, but a language for understanding the world. But over the years, I've gradually realized that even the most elegant code can't solve the flaws of reality. When instant noodles stockpiled during the lockdown piled up in the corner, when I discovered unfair clauses hidden in the rental contract, the utopia on the keyboard shattered into pieces. So I began to see technology as a screwdriver—it should be used to tighten loose fairness, not to build higher walls.

Nights are soaked in bizarre imaginations. The game console is my second home: reliving teenage heroic dreams in *StarCraft* campaigns, feeling the warmth of human collaboration through the online signals of *Monster Hunter*. The night last year when I witnessed Li Peinan win the championship with a 0.37% probability, I cried in front of the screen like the high school student who passed the exam years ago. Those virtual worlds built with pixels and code often give me the most genuine courage.

Art is another channel for breathing. Some wonder why I watched the divorce story *Marriage Story* three times; in truth, I saw my own shadow in Nicole and Charlie's arguments—when ideals collide with reality, we all clumsily wield the fragments of love. Heisenberg's line "You can't hesitate when you're skiing" from the play *Copenhagen* became my survival metaphor: there are too many forks in life's road, and overthinking only leads to a cliff. I often listen to Mili's songs; the witch-like chanting of the lead singer reminds me of myself in college, hiding under the covers listening to the *Les Misérables* cassette tape. Ten years have passed, but the struggling souls in my headphones have never aged.

Grape—my blue cat roommate—is responsible for puncturing all seriousness. He sits on the keyboard while I debug critical code, knocks over cups while I write articles, declaring with his furry body: life is not an algorithm to be optimized. In the ten minutes I'm forced to stop working to groom him, I see how trivial those anxieties truly are.

I'm also fascinated with measuring the city with my feet. I often bike from Qingpu to the suburban park; the eighteen-kilometer journey is a natural meditation pod. Once, after a sudden downpour, I stopped on an empty bridge to watch the clouds. As vmz's scolding and speech poured through my headphones, I suddenly burst into tears. The chill of the wind rushing into my shirt told me more precisely than any static philosophy lying in books: only practice is the ultimate destination of philosophy.

I'm still learning how to exist honestly. I once wore idealism as armor, only to later find it was merely a leaky sail; I once believed technology could save everything, but now I understand tools can't save those unwilling to reach out. Now I'm more willing to crouch down and look: at the steaming bowl of meatball spicy soup on a bench by a Xi'an street, at the rain-soaked spiderwebs on a Hangzhou mountain path, at the fine lines in the corner of a friend's eye when they send a photo of their child's full moon. These specific, tiny spots of light are perhaps more worth chasing than the abstract sun in the distance.

If you meet me, it might be in the queue at a Fusion exhibition, in the discussion thread of an issue in an open-source community, or beside a bike with a flat tire by the Suzhou Creek. Then we can chat about the Black Dragon's flaws, Keats' nightingale, or simply share headphones and listen to *Summoning 101*—after all, some signposts can only be seen in a chorus.
