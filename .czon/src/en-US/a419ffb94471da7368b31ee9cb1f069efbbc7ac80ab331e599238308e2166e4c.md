2017-02-05 Update:

A few days ago, I happened to meet a senior who also attended the same university as me. During a casual chat, he asked which high school I went to. I said, "Huanghe." He exclaimed, "Then you must have been the top student at your school!"

Since starting university, I've been asked this question many times by local Xi'an classmates. The responses are either exclamations like the one above or simply not knowing about the high school.

Honestly, I wish I could say, "I was the last in my high school class."

## Explanation of the Title

The title contains two very colloquial words: **lively ones** and **special skill**. Although those who understand will get it, I still feel it's necessary to explain, as a matter of responsibility.

These words carry a strong personal touch—they were catchphrases of my high school homeroom teacher, Old Cao. Taught by Old Cao, you'd likely hear such phrases countless times over the three long years. Yet, even three years after graduation, I dare not say I've mastered them. It's more like standing at the doorway, peeking inside. As for **what door, what is a door**, I hope you'll ponder carefully.

This piece is dedicated to all my juniors from high school.

## Self-Introduction

Due to a certain professional habit, I don't want to overly restrict the readers of this article, nor will I make more limiting assumptions about them than I do for my juniors—I shouldn't be your senior by three years, nor by six.

With this in mind, I hope you simply see me as the **basic**, **label-free** **person** I describe—I hope you clearly understand my purpose in writing this.

## Sima Zhao's Intentions

As for why I wrote this article, I struggled for a long time but couldn't find a proper reason to give it as a preface to others. We are so contradictory: how capable must one be to have the qualification to stand at a certain height and educate others? **They neither need this qualification nor can ever achieve it.**

So, I'll simply ignore the qualification issue. I wrote it because of a long-hidden impulse within me to share life experiences. But deep down, I feel that by telling you, I can summarize and account for (my past) self: mutual benefit, why not?

## Among Any Three People, There Is Always a Teacher

In high school, I considered myself exceptionally clever, so to this day, I've never admired anyone solely for their intelligence. Still, I enjoy interacting with smart people because communication is easier. **But back then, I didn't understand the difference between being clever and being young.**

In my first year of high school, there was a classmate we called J.

J's mind was incredibly sharp, so much so that even I thought he was clever back then. Sparks attract each other. High school textbooks are one-sided and full of holes (knowledge gaps), especially in physics, chemistry, and biology, where you could find hinted but unexplained issues on almost every page. We'd take these questions to the teachers' office next door to bother them—a highly commendable learning attitude. Sometimes, after thinking for a moment, the teachers would give us answers; other times, they'd brush us off with excuses like `"It's not on the college entrance exam."`—Looking back, maybe our questions were too tricky, but at the time, we immediately elevated it to the level of `"China's education system is a factory producing garbage."` We were really too clever.

We quickly became inflated, J even more so. Perhaps because of this, when I think of J now, all that remains is his habit of mentioning `"IQ"` in every other sentence and his utterly arrogant remark, `"A bunch of idiots."`

**This is thinking without learning.**

Indeed, I often pondered questions about the stars and the cosmos until midnight. My heart held the sun and moon, but I didn't understand the principle of `"A steed's leap cannot cover ten paces; a nag's ten-day journey succeeds through perseverance."` This was a pitfall I stepped into.

J's attitude clearly fell into the trap of so-called `"China's cramming education,"` but I ultimately didn't sink with J.

In my second year, I switched classes and met another classmate—let's call him Y.

Y studied extremely hard and was a rule-following student. I don't know how late Y studied every day or whether he did anything besides studying after going home—these things are beyond my knowledge. But at school, whenever I saw Y, except during times like morning exercises when studying wasn't possible, Y was diligently working hard: taking notes seriously in class—without reading them, I could guess he wrote down every word the teacher wrote on the blackboard, maybe even the typos; doing homework seriously after class—when he encountered something he didn't understand (roughly once per problem, except for those already done), he'd ask the top students in class or the teachers, regardless of whether they were chatting with others or doing work that shouldn't be easily interrupted.

Y often had questions during class about something the teacher just explained: not understanding what it meant, when in fact, it had just been taught—at that moment, Y was copying the previous board notes. If you copy every single word, you can never keep up with the teacher.

I often lamented that if I worked as hard as Y, there'd be nothing I couldn't achieve. Yet Y himself, in my view, accomplished nothing. On the surface, he seemed diligent and hardworking, but in reality, he was dull and rigid—I call it a form of advanced laziness. Apart from the part of his brain used for rote memorization, the rest probably went unused.

**This is learning without thinking.**

`"Learning without thinking leads to confusion; thinking without learning leads to peril."` We've heard many such phrases repeatedly, understanding their meanings but unwilling to carefully ponder the principles they contain. Because we don't grasp these principles, we all lean toward either J or Y to some extent, becoming tragic figures. Either unrecognized talents, buried geniuses, or those who lack internal understanding and external application, achieving nothing in three years.

## Swift Horses Are Common

I hope to share my thoughts in the previously agreed-upon capacity but don't want to preach by listing principles. As mentioned earlier, words are fingers, and the principles between the lines are the bright moon. Pointing at the moon with a finger often makes people mistake the finger for the moon. **It's better to guide you to find it yourselves.**

> One who harbors thunder in their chest but maintains a calm demeanor is worthy of being a great general.
