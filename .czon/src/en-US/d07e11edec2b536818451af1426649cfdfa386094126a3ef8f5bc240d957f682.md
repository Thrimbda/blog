"title": "Reflections and Thoughts After a Failed Defense"
"summary": "This article documents the author's profound reflections following a failed defense for a major innovation project. The author analyzes multiple reasons for the failure: overly simplistic and content-lacking PPT, insufficient expressive ability leading to unclear logic, and a lack of deep understanding of the project, ultimately attributing it to an attitude of 'not putting in enough heart.' The article also extends to reflections on what makes a good product—meeting basic human needs, being user-friendly, and serving as a bridge between technology and humanity—while exploring issues of information asymmetry in social structures. It hints that the author's project, Light, might address such problems. Through this experience, the author emphasizes the importance of diligence in overcoming shortcomings and expresses feelings of shame and a determination to improve."

Five hours have passed since the defense ended. I feel as if a layer of skin has been peeled off, overwhelmed with shame. Silently riding my bicycle, I blend into the sycamore-lined path. Fortunately, there are only strangers around, giving me a moment to catch my breath.

<!--more-->

Escape.

This is indeed the thought I haven’t had time to articulate into words. I fear any possibility of deceiving myself.

So I need to think: Where exactly did things go wrong?

## The Defense

We included Light, the online judging platform we’ve been working on and which I’ve been fascinated by, in our application for the major innovation project. To gain support, or perhaps to put some pressure on ourselves, we decided to do this. Ah Zheng asked me to be the lead for this project, responsible for handling all related matters. After hastily submitting the application, I learned that the defense was scheduled for noon today, and I had two days to prepare.

So, at noon today, I suffered a crushing failure. The judges gave me the impression that they had no idea what I was talking about, thinking I was daydreaming, fabricating ideas out of thin air, and trying to pitch a nonsensical project to secure funding.

Where did things go wrong?

### External Factors

A total of eight groups defended their projects today, and I was the last one. The judges were indeed not professional, even giving off a sense of arrogance. But can they be blamed for this?

No. If our product is meant for the general public, it must be simple enough, easy to understand and use. Therefore, if even judges in the relevant field couldn’t grasp or understand it, then it must be a poorly defined product.

So, let’s think further: Where did things go wrong?

### Surface-Level Issues

There was clearly something wrong with my PPT style. During the Q&A session after the defense, the judges spent half their time pointing out issues with the PPT. This problem was likely the most直观 and frustrating.

This was caused by a belief I’ve held more firmly in recent defenses: PPTs should outline key points, while the content should be delivered verbally.

This in itself isn’t a problem, but this time, I fell into a pathological obsession: only titles, no body text, not even complete content.

Simplicity isn’t the issue; the issue is being简陋.

No data, no charts, no examples—I lacked everything that could clarify the points and make the presentation clearer.

But was it just the PPT that ruined the defense? I’m afraid it wasn’t that simple.

### Expressive Ability

I am well aware of my weakness: severely lacking expressive ability. But do I truly understand this?

Even with a PPT like mine, if delivered properly, it might still have been possible to explain things clearly for this defense.

Lack of coherence in language, disconnected logic, incomplete expression—on top of that, I stammered, forgot my words. All of these were致命伤.

Thus, the surface-level PPT issues暴露了 my shortcomings in expressive ability.

But can these shortcomings be changed? I believe they can. However, knowing I had these weaknesses, I didn’t take appropriate measures to avoid exposing them—I could have.

What else?

### Understanding of the Project

I’ve actually had a similar defense before during training in Chengdu. That time, the PPT wasn’t as夸张 as this one, and my delivery was much better. I believe the secret then was that, as the project manager, I had a全局 grasp: I designed every detail of the system, understood every aspect of the API server and why it was designed that way. I clearly knew what kind of system I was building, who it was for, and its potential for future development.

But this time was different. I don’t think I fully understood Ah Zheng’s vision for the entire system: the analysis of users’潜在需求, the definition of the system, and its future, especially its developmental prospects.

### The Root Cause

Ultimately, where did things go wrong?

**Not putting in enough heart.**

If I had深入思考 the entire project and formed my own深刻理解;

If I had rehearsed before the defense;

If my PPT had more content;

This defense likely wouldn’t have been如此丑陋.

**In short, I feel ashamed.**

Diligence can弥补拙劣, not tranquility leading to远大 goals. I hope I can remember this.

## Reflections

After dinner, I took a walk around campus with my glasses and a bottle of soy milk. North of the library, I found a small garden where I could think quietly.

There, I summarized why my defense turned into a mess and reflected on what makes a good product.

### A Thought Experiment

Newton said he was merely a child picking up shells by the sea of truth, while we are a species with an insatiable thirst for knowledge.

I believe there are two types of pioneers in the journey of exploration:

+ Creators of technology
+ Implementers of technology

The first type builds from great heights, worthy of remembrance and a place in history, serving as the pride of their era and a beacon for future progress. The second type thinks deeply and thoroughly, connecting technology and humanity in a natural and harmonious way, truly realizing progress.

—Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction; Edison and Tesla created the entire electrical age.

Thus, I define a good product as follows:

​	**It满足人的某种基本需求, is足够方便使用, and becomes a纽带联结技术与人文.**

### Returning to the Starting Point

I looked up at the towering sycamore trees. Everything has a structure.

How do we抽象, model, and analyze the内在联系 of things? How do we see the essence beneath surface-level phenomena?

Human society also has a structure. The depth of perspective and mastery of information resources are also ways to划分结构. If everyone is born the same, then education provides the ladder for structural change. However, this still cannot resolve the矛盾 caused by information asymmetry. For example, people at the高层 of this structure and those at the低层 can only communicate through media, analogous to a C/S architecture. Currently, there is no efficient way to match information seekers with providers (peer to peer).

**Perhaps Light can solve such problems? This remains to be explored.**
