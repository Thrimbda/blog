Just a few farewell dinners, a few items left to pick up, and in a few days, I will truly graduate, leaving the sweet dreamland to once again set foot on the soil of reality.

Just now, I was chatting with the class monitor. We both knew in our hearts that this was probably the last conversation before graduation. We talked about nothing but our futures, ending with a phrase like a secret code. I sent it out, and he sent it back: **Be a Light to the World**.

It comes from the school anthem of Xi'an Jiaotong University.

> How splendid is our school, a flower of truth, a model for youth, the glory of the nation,
>
> The school flag flutters, growing with the sun, be a light to the world, be a light to the world.
>
> How splendid is our school, inspiring the masses, enlightening our wisdom, igniting our passion,
>
> Talented and diligent, managing the four directions, be a light to the world, be a light to the world.
>
>
>
> How splendid is our school, a fountain of spirit, the abode of science, the garden of art,
>
> Expanding industry, progress without bounds, be a light to the world, be a light to the world.
>
> How splendid is our school, a brilliant civilization, practical learning strengthens the nation, the nation achieves revival,
>
> Vast is the universe, high are the mountains and long the rivers, be a light to the world, be a light to the world.

Graduation is imminent. There are many things and people I haven't had time to deal with or bid farewell to, and I am about to be swept away by the torrent of the times—either dashed against the broader shores of fate or riding the waves, forging ahead, becoming a navigator of the era. Not to mention the overused but beautiful phrase: "Our journey is to the stars and the sea." Ambition and lofty aspirations are always present, especially at this moment—the moment of parting, of ending, of new beginnings. This sentiment, I believe, can only be expressed by the phrase "be a light to the world" from the school anthem of my alma mater, which I both love and resent and am about to leave.

## Jiaotong University

> When heaven and earth connect, all things flow; when above and below connect, their wills unite.

~~I've finally graduated, so I can freely refer to it as my alma mater now.~~

### Failed Our Way into Jiao Tong?

I don't remember which senior I heard it from: "People at Xi'an Jiaotong University have a certain resentment, even to the point of 'failing their way into Jiao Tong.'" This impression was very profound for me when I first entered university four years ago: even before the semester started, I glimpsed the depression of a new classmate who had failed to get into Peking University, with the exact words being "**living towards death**." This sentiment was especially palpable in student clubs and organizations—everyone was unhappy, feeling they had been shortchanged by ending up here. My future "roommate" also confided in me during a late-night talk that he felt like a stray dog, his plans disrupted, dreams shattered, and a disgrace to his teachers!

Narrowing it down to my major: the air was even more saturated with a sense of despair. Due to its low admission score, this major became a convenient place to reassign students, and all freshmen had the opportunity to transfer into it without cost during enrollment to attract students. **It seemed incredibly cheap, a major even ghosts would disdain. How could those who came here not disdain themselves?** During military training, leaders from the neighboring School of Electronic and Information Engineering came to greet us. Out of 3,500 freshmen standing on the track field, 800 rose, crowding one corner until it was packed, creating a spectacular scene. The School of Software, however, had only one department—Software Engineering. When leaders came, only about eighty people gathered sparsely, a pitiful and lonely sight. But I was naive and didn't think about these things at the time; instead, I took the opportunity to observe the girls I had never seen before.

The above mindset is a commonality among students at Jiaotong University and in the Software Engineering program. I might be an exception because my classmates and I all got into university based on our own merits. Why could they "fail their way in" based on merit, while I couldn't "exceed expectations based on merit" and joyfully enter university without feeling like an unworthy addition? But I could still sense my classmates' disappointment, and I was clearly affected by it. Fortunately, for most people, this mindset lasted at most a year. Once we became familiar with our new base, built new friendships, and even licked our wounds enough to reclaim new dreams, the past disappointments and regrets became insignificant. Only then did we vaguely realize the **new mission and vision** we possessed, just as the school anthem sings, we should "be a light to the world."

### The Cradle of Engineers

During my freshman year, the teacher for the Computer Fundamentals course joked that our university was a "cradle of engineers," meaning it only produced engineers but not leaders—people who become the backbone of society but are mostly buried in the torrent, serving as the solid foundation for the superstructure. He commented on the school motto: **"Diligent in learning, sincere in ambition, resolute in action, loyal and forgiving in responsibilities."** It seemed to me he had grievances he couldn't fully express—both admirable and frustrating. I couldn't say I disagreed, but I lamented that students weren't taught to set lofty ambitions.

This actually aligns well with my own characteristics: **unsuited to be a leader, unwilling to be a follower, but worthy of being an observer.** I'm not foolish, but each of the four points in the school motto is something I lack and need to learn. As for the rest, principles and applications need to be savored in the details of life, without hindering progress. Additionally, I have a strange ability—to inadvertently say what I most want to say and do what I truly want to do. Sometimes, this stumbling can lead to painful collisions, but after pruning the dead branches and withered leaves, one truly becomes more spirited.

Thus, under the influence of the resentment described earlier and through my own unintentional yet sincere choices, I moved forward with unsteady steps. The various events in life, when strung together, make the coincidences and narrow escapes seem incredible in hindsight. If I were to attend university a second time, it would be entirely different. These events include deciding at 4 a.m. the night before the election to abandon the student union, feeling it was better to contribute to the Microsoft Student Club family I loved, where I stayed for four years; later, after lunch at Wutong Yuan, seeing the Robotics Team I had long admired setting up a booth and happily signing up, spending a year with the rule "attend the team except during class hours, Friday afternoons, and a ten-day holiday during the New Year," which greatly enhanced my overall technical sensibility and confidence; signing up for the Microsoft Student Summer Camp during my sophomore year on a whim and meeting a respected friend who, as a small favor before graduation, helped arrange my current path; interning at a lab, gaining a unique early experience of graduate student life at our university and firmly deciding not to pursue a master's degree; during the lab internship, taking on a freelance project that later left me so discouraged. Please note that the times mentioned below are in the past perfect tense:

> Last September, because I was short on money, I took on a freelance website project scheduled to launch at the end of October. Little did I know it would become a veritable `tar pit` that I couldn't complete even after a semester. Hence, this **mythical man-month** tale emerged as a lesson for me—a lesson in not humbly learning from the earnest teachings and valuable experiences of predecessors, being self-righteous, and ultimately ending up in a mess, writing ugly code before looking back and understanding the truth. I also hope to use this as a summary of my personal learning journey, trying to extract some insights and ultimately elevate my own understanding a little.

And finally, the half-year rush to learn from scratch for studying abroad, which I had planned but didn't anticipate, only to make a sharp turn at the critical moment [matter](http://0xc1.space/2017/12/10/%E8%A1%8C%E7%99%BE%E9%87%8C%E8%80%85%E5%8D%8A%E4%B9%9D%E5%8D%81/). I ended up sitting on my bed, writing this essay with great relish.

**The eagerness of the first year, the arduous accumulation of the second year, the happiness and helplessness of the third year, and the confusion and calmness of the fourth year—these are the blood and fire of my time in this cradle.**

Thus, I don't feel discouraged about being trained as an engineer. Doesn't Google in the West also advocate "ask the engineer"? During the 120th anniversary of my alma mater the year before last, I asked myself, "Can I be a light to the world?" A candid friend replied, "Just a code farmer."

I only hope to be the kind of code farmer who cannot be easily replaced, **nurturing immortal logical fruits from the fields of thought**.

### Remember the Source When Drinking Water

There was once an anecdote on campus: two men got into a fight in a classroom, prompting a boy in red to stand up and shout, "This is Xi'an Jiaotong University, a world-class institution, and you're here making a scene. Do you think that's appropriate?!" It caused a sensation across the campus at the time, sparking a wave of thought...

I also recall an article that flooded my social media feed during the anniversary celebrations: "Jiaotong University ≠ Shanghai Jiaotong University." There seem to be five Jiaotong Universities nationwide with the same roots: Shanghai Jiaotong University, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Southwest Jiaotong University, Beijing (Northern) Jiaotong University, and National Chiao Tung University (Hsinchu). Among them, Shanghai Jiaotong University and Xi'an Jiaotong University are the most closely related, originating from the Nanyang Public School founded by the Beiyang Government in 1896. The Nanyang Public School was renamed several times, eventually becoming Jiaotong University, then National Jiaotong University. Finally, on its 60th anniversary, the main part of the university relocated westward to the vast northwest to support development and construction, growing into Xi'an Jiaotong University. The part that remained in Shanghai operated independently for three more years, becoming today's Shanghai Jiaotong University. Due to various factors, Shanghai Jiaotong University has excelled and become the standout among the five sibling universities. Thus, the resounding name "Jiaotong University" has silently become synonymous with Shanghai Jiaotong University in the minds of scholars and the public at home and abroad. This reignited the自尊心 (self-esteem) of Xi'an Jiaotong students, who already felt they had "failed their way into Jiao Tong," leading them to speak up for their beloved alma mater. Even the fact that former President Jiang Zemin later only visited Shanghai Jiaotong and not Xi'an Jiaotong sparked resentment. I share this sentiment too. A few days ago, a senior from another school saw a photo of me with former President Jiang and exclaimed in surprise, "President Jiang is also from Jiaotong University?" thinking he had misspoken and corrected himself: "Xi'an Jiaotong, not Jiaotong University." I stuck out my tongue at the screen.

Interestingly, all five Jiaotong Universities have an almost identical "Remember the Source When Drinking Water" monument, with a three-dimensional school emblem at the top and the words "饮水思源" engraved on it. Once we truly enter the现实修罗场 (real-world battleground), as long as we hear someone is a fellow student or senior from Jiaotong University, we feel an immediate sense of亲切 (closeness). Some even take it a step further, truly implementing the idea that it's Jiaotong University不分西交上交 (without distinguishing between Xi'an and Shanghai), and thus go to Shanghai Jiaotong for graduate studies. **After the jokes, heroes are不问出处 (not asked about their origins); everyone relies on their own abilities. Loving one's school is another matter of emotion; we just need to remember to remember the source when drinking water.**

## Beautiful Dream, Reality

> Giving this title might make it seem like I'm沉迷于空想 (indulging in fantasies) while ignoring reality, but that's both true and not true.

As mentioned at the beginning of this article, "**leaving the sweet dreamland to once again set foot on the soil of [reality](http://0xc1.space/2018/03/08/'Tis-not-through-envy-of-thy-happy-lot/).**" Since my internship in Beijing starting in mid-January this year, I've realized the preciousness of campus life. I once inwardly shouted, "Why don't I just go back to school and be a slacker before graduation?!" **In reality, internship life is新奇有趣 (novel and interesting),充满干劲 (energizing), and there are opportunities to suddenly realize it's already 11 p.m.** What I want to say is that campus life is like a beautiful dream. Every time I return to school, I续上了这酣甜的梦乡 (continue this sweet dream).

Thus, in early March, I played games until 4 a.m.; in early April, I slept until noon, ordered a box of roast duck rice, spent the afternoon hanging around the college, had dinner at Kangqiao, took a shower at the温泉浴室 (hot spring bathhouse), and bought lemon black tea at the small shop; in early May, I added buying卷馍豆腐凉菜和面筋 (rolled pancakes, tofu, cold dishes, and gluten) at the southeast gate in the evening—we called this "味觉巅峰 top of the taste"—to spend my "typical day" on campus. Even sweating on a staircase on campus felt incredibly blissful, like returning home after an eternity in a世外 (world beyond) to find everything unchanged.

However, on the high-speed train back to school for my thesis defense in June, my heart was as calm as still water. It felt like waking from a long, deep sleep with sunlight shining on the covers, the浓睡 (deep sleep) not yet fully dissipated, body and mind rested,浮上水面 (floating to the surface) from the depths of sleep, opening my eyes, serene and satisfied. Though beautiful, the dream was终究是深睡眠的梦 (ultimately a dream of deep sleep), where only the eyes and ears were active, learning and listening. Now awake, I have the strength to施展 (act). Qian,元亨利贞 (originating, penetrating, advantageous, steadfast), the first line changes to the second and third lines,潜龙出水 (the hidden dragon emerges from the water). It's time to寻见大人 (seek the great person) and then终日乾乾 (be diligent all day),警惕朝夕 (vigilant morning and evening).

The novelty of the first two years of university wasn't fully savored before the latter two years flew by like a rocket. Many of these stories I told to my diary;更多故事 (more stories) I was too lazy to tell it. But the原始未受扰动的环境 (pristine, undisturbed environment) gave me countless opportunities to make良性错误 (benign mistakes) that wouldn't knock me out of the game and to learn knowledge about avoiding mistakes, distinguishing those恶性错误 (malignant mistakes) that, once made, would knock me out with no chance for补救 (remedy). The process of making mistakes and the taste of their consequences are the most unpleasant, allowing me to加深印象 (deepen my impression),舔舐伤口 (lick my wounds), and learn from them. In the play *Copenhagen*, Heisenberg says, "Left, right, or think about it and die." I deeply agreed and posted it on social media to警示自己 (warn myself). But upon细细回想品味 (careful reflection and savoring), I realized the context for this phrase is skiing. In such a紧张刺激的运动 (tense and thrilling sport), one can only turn left or right based on muscle memory formed from previous falls. If one thinks at that moment, they'll miss the时机 (timing), meet their end, and be判出局 (ruled out) by fate. The key is to不断思考、不断摔跤、不断形成新的肌肉记忆 (constantly think, constantly fall, constantly form new muscle memory) in a缓和的环境 (gentle environment) so that in truly险恶的环境 (perilous environments), one can敏捷机智地转左、转右 (agilely and cleverly turn left or right) and enjoy the刺激与快乐 (thrill and joy)极限运动 (extreme sports) bring.

I预感 (foresee) that the life ahead will still be filled with opportunities to make良性错误 (benign mistakes) and moments of不犯任何错误 (making no mistakes at all). The process won't be轻松愉快 (easy or pleasant), but it will绝对引人入胜 (absolutely captivating).
