"summary": "This article elaborates on the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, including its core concepts such as objects like Subject, Role, Permission, Session, and their many-to-many relationships. It explains RBAC as a neutral and flexible access control technology suitable for systems with shared resources and hierarchical roles, such as commercial companies and operating systems adhering to the principle of least privilege. The author also contrasts RBAC with Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and Discretionary Access Control (DAC), noting that these models are often mixed in practical applications, using WeChat as an example to illustrate a hybrid scenario. The article further discusses the limitations of RBAC, emphasizing its constraints in personal resource systems."

## Concepts of RBAC

RBAC (**R**ole-**B**ased **A**ccess **C**ontrol) is a more neutral and flexible access control technology compared to Mandatory Access Control and Discretionary Access Control.

First, the objects in RBAC:

- S = Subject = A user or automated agent
- R = Role = Defined as a job position or title with an authorization level
- P = Permission = A method of accessing resources
- SE = Session = The mapping relationship between S, R, or P
- SA = Subject Assignment
- PA = Permission Assignment
- RH = Role Hierarchy. Can be represented as: ≥ (x ≥ y means x inherits y's permissions)

Second, the relationships between these objects are as follows:

- **Subject** and **Role** have a many-to-many relationship.

  ${\displaystyle SA\subseteq S\times R}$

- **Role** and **Permission** have a many-to-many relationship.

  ${\displaystyle PA\subseteq P\times R}$

## Understanding RBAC

After understanding the concepts related to RBAC, here are my thoughts.

RBAC is a type of MAC (**M**andatory **A**ccess **C**ontrol), meaning the system administrator uniformly configures and manages user roles.

The relationship between **S** (Subject), **R** (Role), and **SE** (Session) is as shown in the diagram above. Although a subject can have multiple roles, the subject can only exercise the authority of one role during a login session (i.e., during a session with the system).

**P** (Permission) is determined by the services provided by the system. It is essentially a combination of resources provided by the system and the operations performed on those resources. It is this combination of resources and operations that gives meaning to the concept of permission.

### Applications

My definition of RBAC application scenarios: **A system where resources are shared by the system and have multiple hierarchical roles with distinct responsibilities.**

Resources are shared by the system, and there are multiple, hierarchical roles. This indicates that the significance of resources in the system varies for each role, and thus the responsibilities each role bears for the resources also differ. Therefore, for such systems, RBAC is a highly suitable access control model. It can effectively allocate rights and responsibilities, thereby better protecting and utilizing the resources in the system.

Examples include commercial companies and operating systems that adhere to the principle of least privilege.

For a system where resources are owned by individuals, each role is equal, and each role has complete control over its own resources. In this case, the RBAC model may fall short, and the DAC (**D**iscretionary **A**ccess **C**ontrol) model should be used instead. This is very common in social network systems.

In real-world scenarios, there is no purely shared resource or purely exclusive resource. Therefore, these two models are often mixed. For example, in WeChat, ordinary users have complete management permissions over their own "resources" (such as Moments). However, ordinary users cannot manage other users. The implementation of the "report" function relies on intervention by other roles in the system with higher permissions.
