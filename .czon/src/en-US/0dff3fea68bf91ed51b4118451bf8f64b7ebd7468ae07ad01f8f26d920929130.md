On the last day of May, I realized Bryan was gone.

<!--more-->

There is no evidence to prove Bryan's departure. We didn't need a farewell, so his leaving had no exact time.

I realized this on my way home from work. That night, I was walking across from Tsinghua University. It was past ten, and the bike shed was probably locked, so I decided to leave my bike at the office and follow my late-night routine: orange juice, music loud enough to drown out the street noise, and a touch of leisure. About two hundred meters later, passing the only spot on Tsinghua East Road where you can see the full moon, the thought crept into my mind—Bryan seemed to have left.

On my way downstairs, I saw two people casually sitting cross-legged on the marble platform next to the stone lions at the building entrance, chatting, possibly with drinks. I only dared to glance; a direct stare might be impolite, or maybe they wouldn't care even if I stared, but at least I wanted to preserve the rare image of these two in my mind. What were they talking about? Was it about the present, the past, or the future? Was it a chance encounter or a long-awaited meeting? I had no way of knowing. I turned and walked into the convenience store, raising my orange juice in a distant toast to them.

From my observation, Tsinghua East Road has a slight slope, or perhaps, as S says, it's just that the commute home feels easier because work always brings a bit of resistance. My attention shifted to the depths of my mind, pondering another farewell I never received, and the reason my roommate left without saying goodbye. We had discussed renewing the lease earlier and agreed he would move out. Unexpectedly, on that morning when I woke up, my roommate, who had just played Plants vs. Zombies with me the night before, had vanished along with all traces of his presence. It's hard not to wonder if you did something wrong, to imagine what he would have done if I were a true friend—but from the premise of his sudden departure, it's clear I wasn't a qualified friend, and that is deeply saddening.

But deep down, I couldn't ignore the bigger premise—we were indeed true friends. Because hearts aren't made of stone. Even someone as introverted as my roommate, always afraid of causing trouble and thus so reserved, could be moved by life. Those late-night discussions that started with technology but expanded to technology itself, people, and the world; those intriguing logical traps and puzzles: What is the contrapositive of "If you haven't been to the Great Wall, you're not a true man"? We'd assume we were machines, trying to think with mechanical logic, and often end up staying up until three or four in the morning, despite planning to sleep early, only to repeat the same mistake the next day. Or simple greetings, or walks. All these things at least fulfilled my own definition of friendship. Though you can never truly know what another person is thinking, based on past experiences, such behaviors only occur when the other person shares similar thoughts.

**I thought, perhaps I would receive a letter, or a foreseeable farewell.**

There's no uncertainty; I would wait for that letter forever.

At this point, I began to feel certain that Bryan, as an independent person, had completely vanished. I could find no trace of him in my mind.

Memories of Bryan also grew hazy. He always seemed to carry a certain melancholy, different from mine—his was purer, without specific reasons. Perhaps he enjoyed this moon-like sorrow, the loneliness that simmered in his chest like a slow fire. Or maybe it was a ritual for him, cleansing his soul through melancholy.

Bryan's last story happened a few days ago when the electromagnetic door downstairs wouldn't open. He was holding a bag of trash, planning to throw it out and buy himself a bag of whole-grain bread from the bakery for dinner—I had been at home all afternoon. Bryan repeatedly pressed the door switch, to no avail. He pushed against the door with his body, but it didn't budge, not even making much noise, just a dull thud.

The logic is simple: for example, when supplies are plentiful, staying at home for ten days or half a month without going out is no problem. But once we know the door is locked from the outside, the taste of freedom becomes irresistibly tempting. At that point, staying home for even an hour feels unbearable. You'd rather jump out the window than stay inside—there's no room for negotiation. Bryan was the same. The thought of just eating something at home crossed his mind, but simply because the door was broken, he had to go out. **Going out became the sole reason, motivation, and purpose**; dinner became less important.

So Bryan heard the crows cawing outside, as if he had become one of them. He went to the stairwell between the first and second floors, opened the window to freedom. The window was small, only big enough for him to squeeze through curled up, but Bryan felt as happy as if he were flying. On the second-floor platform, gripping the security bars, Bryan imagined himself as a skilled explorer, stretching his foot to find a foothold. The final step was stepping onto the mailbox of the building unit and jumping down, breathing in freedom as real as the air. I took out my key and tentatively tried opening the door from the outside. It opened. Picking up the trash, I embarked on the journey to find dinner.

That night, I witnessed such a magnificent sunset.

I finally received that email from my roommate—his apologies and gratitude, the entire message proof of our friendship. After 211 days as roommates, I was considered a warm person, a qualified friend. And after about a year of reflection and self-cultivation, along with recent signs, Bryan, as the persona I used to escape my own negative emotions, has disappeared. The event that gave birth to Bryan years ago and long tormented me as Bryan ultimately made me a more authentic and composed person.

Frank Lloyd Wright's words can serve as the final verdict on the entire Bryan episode:

> Unconscious hypocrisy is terrible enough, but for any creative artist, conscious hypocrisy will more ruthlessly corrode their soul. No coward can create a work of art—I believed this then, and I still believe it today.

Finally, to summarize: earlier writings mentioned that I couldn't see my own path clearly but wasted effort on trivial skills. Now I realize that no matter what goals I have, all efforts are aimed at becoming a better person—someone emotionally stable, clear-minded, self-aware, focused, and **abundant**. The conclusion from graduation still holds true:

> I foresee that the life ahead will still be full of opportunities to make benign mistakes and moments of making none at all. The process won't be easy or pleasant, but it will be absolutely captivating.

And life is indeed like skiing: turn left, turn right, or think about it and die. We don't just have life; we are possessed by it.
