Hey, today is Zhang Xiaodi's birthday. Whenever I encounter such commemorative days, I can't help but reminisce: what was it like on this day last year? And the year before that?

Of course, for it to be interesting and meaningful, all of this must be based on the fact that this day holds its commemorative significance for me. In the case of Zhang Xiaodi's birthday, this means from the time I met him and started wanting to celebrate his birthday. Fortunately, we met early enough; these nine years have given me plenty to look back on.

First, I want to sincerely wish him a happy birthday in this little corner he can't see. I hope my friend stays healthy and happy, isn't frightened by life's hardships, and can walk his own path with a firm gaze. Reflecting on it, it seems our contact has gradually lessened since university, but that doesn't mean our relationship has drifted apart. On the contrary, I believe our bond hasn't been affected by distance. The greatness of a university lies in its culture.

I've witnessed him hesitate due to comfort in recent years, grieve over betrayal, move forward because of something on his mind, be loved for his kindness, and ultimately, because of fate, I lost two friends and gained a couple who love to show off their affection (to my chagrin).

Ah, people... we have few moments of smooth sailing and many of confusion. But looking back, the dissatisfactions we felt at the time were often just because our capacity for understanding wasn't broad enough yet = =

**Haven't I been the same way?**

## Telling a Story

Language is a marvelous ability, allowing massive amounts of information to rapidly transfer between two individuals—it's never a mere copy, but a leap, vanishing in one medium and being reborn in another—embedding eternity within every fleeting moment through words, expressions, and every possible means.

What kind of process is this?

—Leaping up, piercing through dust and smoke, soaring past birds and beasts, leaving behind the dust, leaving behind the boulders, you who are reading these words finally arrive at—the moon?

To be honest, I don't know where you'll end up.

I used to think life was a network of interconnected roads. People choose their own paths, walking together if they share the same aspirations, parting ways if their goals differ.

Later, I realized it's not that simple. Life isn't a complete graph connecting all possible nodes, where you simply choose a path you deem reasonable and walk it. In fact, it's layered. So many paths, stretching into the distance, collapse into faint traces. In this vast, intricate directed graph, it's easy to lose your way.

Fortunately, being young enough gives a person ample time to jump and weave through these edges, to summarize patterns, beliefs, and methodologies through practice.

We call this **seeing the light through the clouds.**
