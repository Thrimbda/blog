# Ascending the Yue Du Pavilion

Peaks cluster like gatherings, waves roar like fury, mountains and rivers guard the road to Tong Pass.

From the Yue Du Pavilion, the eight-hundred-li Qin Plain unfolds before the eyes:

Behold—fields crisscrossed with paths, roosters crowing and dogs barking, favorable weather and prosperous land, a place blessed with outstanding people!

Here, one gazes north at the grandeur of the Loess Plateau and south at the majesty of the Qinling Mountains and Mount Hua. Nourished by the mighty, surging Wei River, it has fostered the splendid and profound civilization of China!

May we rise with the rooster's crow, carrying forward the legacy while forging ahead!

How fortunate and joyful, I sing to express these sentiments.
