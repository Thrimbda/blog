Although I bet on Falcons to win, seeing Marlin typing trash talk at halftime and then BB pulling off a comeback and the whole team tipping Marlin in retaliation was just too satisfying.

All chat / loves to type.

In 2016, during my sophomore to junior year, my monthly living allowance was 1,000 yuan, and my girlfriend at the time had 1,200 per month.

Her school was in the far southwest of Chang'an District, mine was in Shapocun, and we met every week.

There was a Holiland bakery outside the southeast gate of our school. She was from another school, and when she came to visit me on weekends, she said the half-baked cheesecake was delicious, costing 8 yuan each. We could only afford the two-pack. After buying it, we’d cross the street to take the bus, eating it bite by bite on the overpass.

Later, in my senior year, I found an internship paying 30 yuan per hour. With overtime and bonuses, my monthly income reached over 10,000 yuan—I’d never had so much money before.

During the May Day holiday in 2018, I went alone to the bakery outside the school gate and bought a five-pack. I took the same bus across the street and ate it all by myself.

Her graduate school was in Zhongguancun, my internship was in Wudaokou, and we never saw each other again.

The episode where I miss home the most 😭

Suddenly craving watermelon, I bought one online. It reminded me of how every summer at home, we had watermelon daily. As a kid, my parents would cut it up for me to munch on; now when I go home, I sneak half a watermelon from the fridge to cut up when I’m hungry at night.

Anyway, being at home feels safe, like having a protective shield.

Just cut up the watermelon and ate it—it’s sweeter than every watermelon my parents bought this year, but I miss home so much 😭

Traveling with ZL (Part 4) - Reunion After a Long Time

When over seven hundred days of oppressive time had crawled across the calendar, and a glimmer of light finally shone through my work life, I decided to end this long self-exile. I planned to cross the ocean at the end of September to visit ZL, whom I hadn’t seen in three whole years.

I don’t know when it started, but the beginning of my travels always seems to happen after the journey has already begun. That is to say, there’s no anticipation for one or two weeks before departure, no lying in bed at night imagining the wonderful things that will happen on this trip. It’s just packing and leaving, and right before departure, I was still solving work problems. This made the whole process too rational and lacking in emotion. This continued until I asked for a small bottle of wine on the plane. The warmth rising from my chest after drinking it dispelled this excess rationality. Only then did my anticipation for the unknown and my nervousness about reuniting with an old friend I hadn’t seen in so long begin to dance in my mind.

After getting off the plane and exiting the station, I spotted him. He had cut his hair short and was no longer skinny. Now he was a burly man with just the right hair length. Seeing each other, we couldn’t suppress our smiles as we approached, and the old flames reignited. The outdoor air was a bit chilly, and we ducked into his little car.
Soon, after the joy of reunion settled, whether it was because we hadn’t seen each other for so long or because of the necessities of life in North America, I noticed he seemed to have armored himself with a transparent shell, keeping me and all the unknowns of the world at bay. What he showed the world was an emotionally stable, robust man, but in certain moments, you could glimpse the youthful boy beneath that shell.
Fortunately, it was an unstable shell. In ZL’s car, the scenery along the way quickly crushed the shell under the influence of time. Within 36 hours, we were chatting and joking like we did during those years in Suzhou, and shamelessly commenting on every girl who passed by—except for Asian faces.

Among my many dreams of dissolving into the river and being forgotten by the world, one was to drive along the PCH while listening to Jaden’s song “PCH.” Before reaching Monterey, I mentioned this to ZL. Without a word, he found the song and put it on repeat. Under the clear sunlight, by the misty, azure sea, as the intro to “PCH” flowed out, the sea breeze took shape. We chased the constantly collapsing horizon, and the rolling wheels kept churning out new memories to patch over my lost dreams.

Sometimes the sunset was ahead of us. Fatigued by jet lag, I stared at the twilight in silence while ZL, who was driving, also said nothing. The dusk and lights fell on our faces as we drove toward the immortal sun under the gaze of the twilight gods, and in that silence was an unending conversation. Then he broke the silence: “Tsk, need to find a song that fits this moment,” ZL said as he fiddled with the main control screen.

- P1: ZL has many strange little gadgets. After entering his house, I found a small round sunglasses;
- P3: I brought the bottle of ice wine ZL gave me five years ago to the U.S. and opened it with ZL;
- P7: ZL said he really likes this photo, but it makes me look fat, so I’m not too fond of it;
- P9: Two weeks later, I stayed at ZL’s place again for a night while transiting through San Francisco on my way home.
