There are some things I want to write down.

A bean-sized drop of sweat falls to the ground. I notice another drop landing on the conveyor belt of the security scanner.

Because I had to get from BUPT to Beijing West Station to board the train within half an hour: during the frantic sprint, I only paused to catch my breath while waiting in line, once again noticing the ground.

A year has passed.

Some questions, once they take shape from thoughts into words in the mind, already have answers. This article was started a month ago, born from scattered thoughts. While eating, waiting for the bus, walking, or sleeping, as soon as my mind wanders slightly, they seize the opportunity to sneak into my head from every corner of the world. But when I try to grasp them, they betray me, slipping away as if deliberately keeping their distance.

But regardless, after a whole year, there are always things worth writing about.

## The Old Steed in the Stable

Both ends of this year—the beginning and the end—were marked by the **MSC Summer Camp**, so let’s start from there.

Compared to last year, this time I distinctly felt a sense of loss. The reasons, aside from carrying mental baggage, were that I had reserved the space for such precious memories for last year, holding back somewhat. Thinking about it, I find myself a bit melodramatic—but it’s true. So I didn’t participate much in the discussions, except for one time when a chubby guy in our group proposed an idea so worthy of criticism that I couldn’t help but argue.

On **Day 2**, everyone went to Nanluoguxiang. The familiar subway station railings no longer had Yongge leaning against them, and the bustling alley had lost its novelty for me. While changing the string of a bracelet in one of the small shops, I sacrificed a bead—it flew off onto the street when the shop owner cut the old string and was never found again. Beyond anger, I vaguely felt this was fate.

So I skipped **Day 3’s** City Tour to visit Xiao Dai. I figured a year wouldn’t change a person’s appearance much, so I recognized her at first glance as she rushed out from the direction of the Intelligent Building to open the door. It was truly delightful! Visiting a friend without any baggage. I secretly vowed to remember the library of the Intelligent Building and the punk-style high-rises in Zhongguancun. Two days later, I added another obsession: I must eat the yellow peach beef at BUPT again in this lifetime.

## The Bitter Days Gone By

The brief trip to the capital has already ended.

I returned to my **balanced** but **unstable** life. Balanced because I’m content and don’t seek change. Unstable because underlying pressures make one want to change or become decadent. Long ago, in Chinese class, when I first learned the word “decadence,” I didn’t know it would become my great enemy.

To put it plainly, I’ve been too kind to myself, unwilling to be decisive. I need some stimulation to move forward, to feel immense loss the moment a dream shatters, and thus seek change.

> Forlorn! the very word is like a bell
>    To toll me back from thee to my sole self!

Just like Keats’ sense of loss after watching the nightingale fly away until its song disappeared. Except my pressure doesn’t come from a terminal illness. I’m more youthful and hopeful than this ill-fated poet, but why am I becoming more and more decadent?

**Perhaps this is the most difficult phase I’m experiencing in university.**

But who knows?

## How to Dispel Worries

How to dispel worries? Cao Cao’s answer seems ordinary to me. Drinking is always the easy choice; drowning sorrows in alcohol is something everyone does, but waking up the next day only brings a headache and little else besides prompting reflection on life. The answer to this question may differ for everyone. For me, it seems the root of all problems lies in an inability to calm down; neither anxiety nor carefree ease are normal emotions. So we must survive between these two extremes.

I recently watched a movie: *Bright Star*, which directly uses a sonnet Keats wrote for Fanny as its title. The entire film tells the love story between Keats and Fanny in the three years before his death abroad. The movie is quiet and full of beauty, worth watching with a calm mind. What I want to talk about is Keats himself. After the film’s ending, text appears: *Keats died at twenty-five, believing himself a failure. Today he is recognized as one of the greatest Romantic Poets.* What I want to say is, think about Keats’ experiences. What made him who he was? What caused his early death? Setting aside the possibility that he was a genius—which may not even be a reason—**because we all believe that the times make heroes, and heroes shape the times.** People’s worlds influence each other. Under what circumstances can someone write such poetry? I think perhaps only in England at that time, in such dire straits, could Keats become Keats. People then revered art—poetry certainly included—and life was incredibly harsh. Poets could only break free from reality’s shackles through thought, as described in *Ode to a Nightingale*:

> Away! away! for I will fly to thee,
>
> Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,
>
> But on the viewless wings of Poesy,

So how to dispel worries? What is worth pursuing?

The answer isn’t simple, but we can find clues in what we’ve seen and learned.

## Singing to Express Aspirations

At the beginning of this article, I mentioned my trip to Beijing, so let’s continue from there.

On **Day 5**, Cutuy and I talked almost all night in the hotel, which was very enlightening. I’ve mentioned before that the world is layered. What do we rely on to climb upward? What helps us climb faster? I’ve heard a saying and agree with it: *We can change because we are educated.* Education brings knowledge and, through that knowledge, grants people a broader **perspective**. Through each person’s perspective, we summarize what we see into a methodology to establish ourselves in the world. But different angles of observation lead to different conclusions. Thinking about it this way is quite interesting.

Later, I shamelessly went to BUPT to have a meal with Xiao Dai, then desperately ran (or rode) to the West Station to catch the train. That’s why, at the beginning, sweat dripped to the ground. So I started writing on the train and have been writing for ten days until today. How fortunate, singing to express aspirations.
