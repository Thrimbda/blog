After pondering and considering for nearly a month, I've decided to use a new ID: **Thrimbda**.

What does it mean?

Alive and thrive.

The tail is taken from the English pronunciation of the Greek letter lambda, a letter that represents great wisdom appearing as foolishness.

Thus,

**Thrimbda**!

I wasn't content to end the post so short, so let me ramble a bit more.

## On Dao and Shu

To summarize, the knowledge in this world can essentially be divided into two levels: **Dao** and **Shu**.

Dao is the overview;

It is the framework;

It is having a well-thought-out plan.

Shu, on the other hand, is the detail;

It is the implementation;

It is the arcane techniques.

As for me,

I cannot clearly see my own Dao,

Yet I have put considerable effort into Shu.

How much of it has been in vain!
