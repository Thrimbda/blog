What does travel mean to me?

For some, travel means conquest. Knowing in advance where to go, roughly what to do, then it's about marking the map and achieving milestones.

For me, travel means seeking. There is no physical endpoint; the incompleteness born from leaving home becomes the driving force to move forward on the journey. Carrying this sense of lack, I search for what my heart is missing. I don't know what it is, but whatever it is, it will be the endpoint of this journey. Endpoints are rare, so my travels are often accompanied by anxiety—the longing for an endpoint, and the accompanying fear of never reaching it.

Recording a long-awaited journey.

## The Outbound Journey - A Convoluted Start

The car's battery showed 0%, range 0 km. At this moment, the three of us were still 4 km from Pudong Airport, with 9 minutes left before the check-in counter closed. To make matters worse, Brother Ji suddenly realized he had brought his old passport by mistake...

In the end, only Ah Zheng and I boarded the plane to Chiang Mai. Even after boarding, our hearts were still pounding. I've never believed in bad luck, but today was indeed not smooth sailing.

We were still working right before departure, and we paid a high price for a fatal mistake—this was the starting point of the troubles. After a brief review, we had misjudged the time needed to get from home to Pudong Airport. We set off for Pudong leisurely—driving, then having a designated driver take the car home.

Upon starting the navigation, we found the journey would take an hour and a half longer than expected. This meant if the estimated time was accurate, we would just miss check-in. Relying on Nomi's autopilot for a relaxed drive was impossible. The only way out was to drive boldly yet carefully ourselves, despite factors like traffic jams, rain, and low battery, speeding as much as possible while ensuring safety to gain about five minutes.

After over an hour of frantic driving, we did gain some time, arriving at the scene described at the beginning.

On the plane, I felt somewhat exhausted, as if I had lost my keen sensitivity to life. In the past few hours, I had experienced the frustration of a work mistake, the紧张刺激 of rushing for a flight, and the regret of a companion not making it. Yet, for the upcoming journey, I hadn't felt a shred of anticipation. Thinking carefully, this sense of anticipation for travel seemed to have been absent from my life for a long time.

I turned on airplane mode and fell into a drowsy sleep. Picking up my phone again an hour later, I saw a message from Playground sent an hour ago,大意 that an important matter had finally been resolved as wished. A warm current, tasting like black tea, slowly flowed into my heart. Empathy began to work, and I finally relaxed, letting out a long sigh.

So, what would happen in the coming days? Roughly two days in Chiang Mai, then four in Bangkok. Except for the two nights' accommodation in Chiang Mai, flights and hotels were still unbooked. Amid this chaos, I began to feel a sliver of anticipation for this trip.

## Songkran Festival

Our itinerary正好 coincided with the Songkran Festival, the grandest festival for the Dai-Thai ethnic groups across Southeast Asia. It carries a beautiful寓意: washing away the dust of the past year and starting anew for the coming year.

After resting and preparing for a night, we met up with Brother Ji's friends (though he himself couldn't make it due to the意外). This was the first day of Songkran. Brother Ji's friends had rented a pickup truck, with two large buckets of water on the cargo rack, three water guns for long-range attacks, and four or five small buckets for close combat.

Approaching the moat near the old city, we arrived at a corner of the main battlefield. It was a scene of chaos I had never seen before: people were in disarray, everyone using all suitable containers to splash water at others. The ample supply of ice turned the otherwise harmless lukewarm water into refreshingly cold water. People joyfully shouted and splashed each other.

![image0](https://0xc1.space/images/2024/04/19/fighting_people.jpg)

Boys and girls on the streets indiscriminately drenched every object passing by with water guns, buckets, and various other "weapons." Street vendors either sold food or ice and water for refills (mostly scooped directly from the river), and they themselves joined in the splashing. No one could resist the狂欢 of Songkran. Passersby on bikes could only be splashed; at best, they could pull out their own small water guns during lulls in the火力 to retaliate futilely.

The main force was countless pickup trucks like ours, inching forward on severely congested roads. On the trucks, regardless of gender or age, people were either尽力 spraying water at everyone or being joyfully splashed with ice water,嗷嗷大叫, then snapping back to retaliate seconds later. Some trucks had their own speakers, so the people on them swayed热情 to the rhythm,毫不在意 how others splashed them. Nearly ten people swaying on the truck in the same rhythm made it seem as if the truck itself was bouncing up and down at a rave.

Everyone was laughing and shouting. It was a true狂欢 belonging to all.

Unfortunately, we had to stop midway. On one hand, the scorching sun quickly gave us sunburns. On the other hand, after I went to bed early the previous night, Ah Zheng and the others bought afternoon tickets to Bangkok—大概 thinking Chiang Mai was just a simple appetizer, while Bangkok had everything more引人入胜. I对此不置可否,只是觉得 the Songkran Festival was already fun enough.

As it turned out, we were all somewhat wrong.

After a difficult two-kilometer trek under the烈日, we finally left the heavily congested路段 and took a taxi back to the民宿.

After a hot shower and changing into dry clothes, while packing to head to Bangkok, Ah Zheng realized his phone was missing.

## Urban Chase

I called Ah Zheng's phone several times before confirming it was indeed not in the room.

Anxiety surged. Losing a phone in a foreign country with a language barrier and trying to recover it is no easy task. To make matters worse, we were about to leave for the airport; time was very, very tight.

Initially thinking it was left in the ride-hailing car, we called customer service, but they couldn't contact the driver who took us back either. We had to think of other办法.

Time ticked away, and we were still clueless about how to find the phone. Should we call the police? Would that help?

Got it! Try the iPhone's Find My feature. About every two minutes, Ah Zheng could see his phone's location update on the Find My app on his Mac. The latest location was a bit north of Chiang Mai's old city. We decided to take a taxi and head to his phone's location to try our luck. A strange mirror image appeared: I used my phone as a hotspot, he held the电脑, and we went out dressed in outfits不太适合 getting wet.

Midway, the driver, unwilling to enter the severe congestion, dropped us off. One holding a phone, the other a电脑, we advanced like two madmen towards the constantly changing定位.

We were definitely going to miss the flight. Fortunately, the民宿 was booked for two days, so we could stay another night.

Midway, I received a call—from Ah Zheng's number. But upon answering,除了 street noise, I couldn't hear anything. It seemed like an accidental touch. This meant the person who found the phone wasn't a thief, as a thief would turn off the phone and wouldn't make such a mistake.

Getting closer and closer. Ah Zheng's phone wasn't moving at car speed; we could catch up by running. The phone left the main road and entered a small alley.

Finally, at the entrance of a phone shop in the alley, we intercepted the scavenger uncle who had picked up the phone. The phone case was already gone. I guess we'll never know whether the uncle intended to sell the phone or let the more knowledgeable phone shop complete the act of returning lost property. Regardless, Ah Zheng expressed thanks and gave some money to thank the uncle.

Retrieving what was lost felt so good! Once again, I experienced the vividness of life in an adventure given by生活. Ah Zheng was also无比兴奋; I'd never seen someone so happy about missing a flight.

## Zoe in Yellow

The moment we found the phone, to celebrate, Ah Zheng asked if we should go for a drink. So I checked the locations of bars in the city. One called Zoe in Yellow looked pretty good. I随即 imagined what kind of place it might be.

In that instant, the future revealed its朦胧的面纱 to me.

However, the direction into the city was filled with疯狂泼水狂徒,渴望均匀地淋湿 everyone in sight. Pleading with gestures was毫无用处. Looking at my freshly changed clothes and shoes, I quickly扑灭 that瞬间的期待 and returned to a理智的状态, deciding not to go after all.

Back at the民宿, after resting and rebooking early morning tickets to Bangkok for the next day (but without eating), my companions later decided to go into the city for some fun. I, who went along, was咕咕叫 from hunger and实在提不起什么兴趣,准备打道回府.

After parting with my companions, I tiredly hailed a Grab motorbike to return to the Maya Plaza near the民宿 for some food, then go back to sleep early.

According to my original plan, I shouldn't have taken the motorbike. The呼啸而过的晚风, mixed with water splashed by pedestrians on the road, washed away my fatigue.

My clothes were溅湿 in the漫天水花. Amid the摩托轰响的引擎声, I撞了个满怀 with the暖洋洋的风. On this early summer night, I甩了甩头发, leaving a few water droplets in the wind, and the wind returned a丝清凉 as thanks.

Perhaps because the Songkran Festival is like a contagious狂欢 virus. Before getting splashed, I was a civilized,体面 person,在意着自己的整洁干爽的衣衫. But after getting wet, I only wanted to join the纵情狂欢的人群, letting the next civilized person在意自己衣服体面 join my行列. It wasn't even 9 PM yet; the timing was正好. I had just entered the city; the location was also正好. I当即决定改道去 Zoe.

Like a shy introvert dragged to a party by a confident extrovert friend, people try to talk to the introvert, who can only smile awkwardly, while the extrovert friend loudly introduces their shy friend to the crowd. Except both were me—a somewhat分裂的,别扭的我, wanting to狂欢却又有点放不开.

Standing at the entrance of Zoe, I heard震天的音乐声 inside. Surrounding the dance floor was a circle of小吃商铺 and bars. I decided to fill my stomach first, maybe have a drink or two.

People were so快活. After a gin and tonic, I was射了个满怀 by a nearby foreigner with a water gun. Damn it! I've had enough of the human form, enough of being a normal,彬彬有礼的人类, enough of理性. To hell with it, today is for狂欢.

I entered the dance floor, first小心翼翼,辗转腾挪, but总是不免被四面八方的水枪照顾到.
Once on the dance floor, the sprinklers above worked like heavy rain, evenly rinsing everyone.

But how do you蹦? This was my first time actually going to a蹦迪 as someone who can't dance. Just sway to the rhythm! Everyone was doing their own thing; I wasn't performing on stage, so there was nothing to be shy about, I comforted myself.

In front of me, slightly斜前方, was a white couple. They embraced and swayed to the rhythm, as if the entire dance floor, or the whole world, consisted only of the two of them embracing,圆满地摇摆着. My heart felt a丝悸动. Was I渴望这样的互动?

Closing my eyes, I瞎跳ed to the rhythm, but was still笨拙, still羞涩.

![image1](https://0xc1.space/images/2024/04/19/dance_in_the_water.jpg)

When I opened my eyes again, this girl with blue braids and a black baseball cap appeared beside me.

—"She dances so freely."
The first thought said. She was背对着 the DJ booth, facing the opposite direction of everyone,肆意地舞动着,优雅且具备力量. It was a power of freedom, as if the world consisted only of the music's rhythm and her own dancing body. Then I caught a glimpse of her head raised due to her舞步.

—"She's so beautiful."
The second thought迸发出来. Water droplets on her face were like dewdrops in the morning晨曦,晶莹剔透. Her slightly arched eyebrows were like willow leaves; the large eyes beneath, with slightly wider spacing, resembled a silver fox. Her极富异域风情的眸子 seemed to possess a奇妙的力量, making one不由自主地沉醉其中. Under the恰到好处的修饰 of法令纹, her mouth appeared优雅而大气, as if a精心雕琢的艺术品,微微张开,透露出一种从容不迫的气息. In her自信的笑容,酒窝若隐若现,仿佛是夜晚星空中藏匿的一颗璀璨星辰,悄然闪耀.

In the声浪 exceeding 100 dB, the world quieted down. I myself became半透明似的. Only this girl danced肆意而自由 under a single spotlight. As if she were the embodiment of music, perfectly融合 with the rhythm. Her blue braids swayed gently with her舞步, like一道道蓝色的波浪在空中划过. Her black baseball cap tilted slightly, adding a touch of不羁和神秘.

I was deeply吸引 by her舞姿, as if time stood still at this moment. Every shrug of her shoulders, every jump, seemed like精心编排的舞蹈, filled with奇异的美感. Her face radiated自信和快乐, that纯粹的享受和自由的表达,仿佛一记重拳打在我的心头.

In this喧嚣的夜晚, she became the唯一的焦点 in my eyes. Her existence made everything around黯然失色. Only her舞步 and the music's rhythm echoed in the air. I仿佛能够感受到 her内心的激情和自由, that不受束缚、尽情释放的感觉.

I wanted to join her自由的舞步,一起享受这份纯粹的快乐.

As the music reached its高潮, her舞步 also became more激烈和狂野. Her body swayed freely with the rhythm, every movement filled with力量和美感. Her eyes闪烁ed with光芒, as if narrating her story and dreams. Her raised right hand敲击着空气, as if the air itself had become an instrument. The声浪 of this instrument echoed in the dance floor,撞击着每个人的胸腔, making them forget their own names, becoming dancing machines.

Then she was拉走 by friends, and I was拽回到了热闹的舞池中.

In the center of the dance floor, sprinklers like暴雨 sent凉爽 into the crowd. I was彻底湿透了,也彻底兴奋起来了.

Inspired by her, I also began to自由起来, no longer拘泥于 my own舞步, no longer担心别人的目光. Letting my body sway freely with the music's rhythm,逐步自信而有力. I felt an前所未有的自由和快乐, as if the whole world was cheering for me.

I was no longer an旁观者, but became part of the music. In the rhythm,奔涌着,怒号着,肆意流淌着, as if a flood about to destroy everything in its path. Making all meaningful symbols消解、融化 into it, joining this汹涌,壮大ing it. Eventually, the world would consist only of the music's rhythm and my不成章法,却又无敌的舞步.

Then, she appeared beside me again, still swaying freely,不顾旁人,只是手上多了一小桶加了冰块、冒着泡的饮料.

Whether it was my错觉 or not, we became a奇妙的双星系统. No matter how people pushed into or left the dance floor, she始终 swayed in front of me.

The night grew deeper. People gradually got into the state,纷纷涌入 the increasingly拥挤的舞池. Our distance也因此而变得更近了.

碰撞,溅出水滴 in the瓢泼"大雨". Her hat touched my chin. "Put your fucking hands up," the DJ on stage said. Her raised hands touched mine in rhythm.

She turned around,夹着 the drink under her arm,双手合十半蹲了一下, saying sorry to me. The羞涩的笑意 in her eyes was as明媚柔和 as黄昏.

She递过来 the bucket of酒 with the straw朝向 me. It tasted like rum with cola. I returned a hug, which I had一直想这么做.

And thus experienced that强烈的冲击.

---

This冲击 pierced my chest like a spear, puncturing the symbolic force field of rationality. Beneath,汹涌的爱欲 erupted like a volcano, trying to catch this外来者 that had雷霆万钧之力戳入我的精神领域.炙热的波涛努力变换ing形态, attempting to修补 the already incomplete force field, trying to capture哪怕一点点的理性和意义, trying to establish a可被理解的形象 for her. This不自觉却又过载运行的努力 didn't succeed. I felt so tired.

It passed through all表象, entered the虚无 of the本体, forming a singularity, where it began its永恒的圆周运动, and would be赋予时间性 in the time to come.

Aye! **supersensible is appearance qua appearance**

## The Journey's Endpoint Arrived at 1/3 of the Itinerary

In that night's dream, I walked towards her as she rested nearby, asking for her contact. She gave me a自信而明媚的笑容.
Then everything褪去了. Waking up, I remembered I had decided not to do this,刻意地 not asking for any information besides her name, letting the狂欢 in the dance floor end and us相忘于江湖.

This was most妙. After tonight, there was no possibility of us meeting again. And my journey would become彻底圆满 because of such遗憾.

In the days that followed, I would still懊恼 why I was so固执, making such a奇怪的决心. I couldn't help but好奇 what story would unfold if I hadn't忍住 and asked for her contact.

But this was most妙. I had to let myself from that day fall into deep迷惘 in such a沉醉的状态. Only then would this encounter become深刻; only then would I痛切地反思, wanting to告别自己过去一年的浑噩; only then could I create a奇异的量子场域, letting imagination迸发不受控制, to create ten million精彩纷呈的宇宙. Yes, I would好奇 what story would unfold if I hadn't忍住 and asked for her contact? That would be ten million different stories, bitter, sweet,平淡无奇, or精彩纷呈. Regardless, I渴望 all possibilities in the life to come. I must use this渴望的脉冲 to make my already疲惫的心 beat强有力 again. I would gain ten million new dreams. Then, I would witness them坍缩 into a reality I尚不知晓,却无比期待.

The journey's endpoint had already been抵达. It was located at 1/3 of the行程. The following days would be used for咀嚼与休息. The重新跳动起来的心脏 needed time to send fresh blood to every cell in the body.

The last hour was spent swaying together. In this清凉的酷暑, Mint stood right in front of me,背靠着我. I placed my head on Mint's shoulder—and she grabbed my hand, placing it on her waist. When a new round of暴雨泼下来, for a瞬间 I held tighter, and Mint also leaned her head against my chin. The water of Songkran washed everything away. I only smelled a faint,生机勃勃的汗味.
