Great! A recent small assignment gave me a chance to truly dive into meaningful concurrent programming.

## Demo

So, I created a small demo using Python's `queue`, `signal`, and `time` modules. It's not truly multithreaded, but serves as an illustrative example:

import signal
import queue
import time


class TestClass(object):
    queue = queue.Queue()

    def __init__(self):
        signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, self.stopIfPressKill)

    def stopIfPressKill(self, mySignal, stack):
        if mySignal == signal.SIGINT:
            print('you pressed CTRL-C')
            self.queue.put_nowait('stop')
            print(self.queue.qsize())

    def mainThread(self):
        while True:
            time.sleep(1)
            if not self.queue.empty():
                data = self.queue.get()
                print(data)
                if data == 'stop':
                    break
                else:
                    self.queue.put(data)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    yoo = TestClass()
    yoo.mainThread()

```

Let me explain the roles of the three modules:

- `queue`: Acts as a message queue, which is admittedly a bit overkill for this simple case.
- `signal`: Used to capture `KeyboardInterrupt` and place a stop signal into the message queue.
- `time`: Allows the main thread to have a chance to catch this `KeyboardInterrupt`.

## Concept

The introduction of multithreading makes it difficult to control non-main threads once they are started, which forces the use of mechanisms like message queues for inter-thread communication.

However, whether multithreaded or not, system modules should encapsulate their internal details and collaborate through events. This greatly helps in reducing system coupling and is a key design philosophy for a good system: **Design for change.**
