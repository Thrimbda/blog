## Hello

I've finally gathered some interest to renovate my dilapidated blog.

In 2024, my life is at a stage where the desire to express can be quickly and easily released offline. Although there are often many things I want to write about, spending time writing articles feels a bit luxurious for me. So, I've been too lazy to maintain my own blog. Coincidentally, Hexo's CI broke down, and I took this opportunity to switch to a new one.

That is, this one.

After briefly looking into NextJS, Gatsby, and Hexo, and to avoid wasting this urge to tinker with the blog, I ultimately chose the single-binary static site generator Zola. I didn't do any specific research, but it does meet my current needs:

1. Write in Markdown.
2. As long as this binary exists, I can still publish via CI ten years from now, without build failures due to outdated dependencies (looking at you, Hexo).
3. The theme is simple enough that I can easily maintain it.

Maybe in the future, when I have time to tinker, I'll try to create a more flexible and flashy blog, but for now, this is it.

Looking back at an article I wrote many years ago when I first set up my blog, it still feels quite interesting, so I'll leave it here.

> After returning to school, I made some changes to my half-dead website and started thinking about the personal blog I've been eyeing for a long time. In the past, because JianShu supported markdown, I eagerly registered. After writing one or two essays, I still felt there were too many restrictions and not enough freedom—you could say I was nitpicking. Seeing Ah Zheng's blog[^1] thriving, I immediately felt that I, Tu Yang, still needed to learn a thing or two.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Ah Zheng said: "Who keeps a diary seriously?" Although his blog link is no longer valid, he's lazy enough that he hasn't deleted the source code. So, if you're interested, you can still take a look: [zccz14's Blog](https://github.com/zccz14/blog/tree/master/src/posts), but it's uncertain if it'll still be there after he sees this article.
