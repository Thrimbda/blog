"title": "The Tree on the Mountain: The Yesterday and Today of Open Source Software"
"summary": "The article uses the Bus Factor mentioned by Henrik Lissner, author of Doom-emacs, as a starting point to reveal the fragility of open source software due to reliance on key members, as seen in the Faker.js incident. Through Bourdieu's field theory, it explains that the open source spirit is essentially hackers pursuing cultural capital (such as reputation). As the software industry expands, open source inevitably merges with commercial logic, giving rise to two forms: traditional hacker-driven projects (like Linux) and commercially-strategic open source companies (like RedHat). The author argues this transformation is historical progress; the improvement of open source infrastructure will break the oracle of division of labor and foster tools usable by everyone. Finally, it emphasizes that while heroes may fade, the open source spirit has taken root in reality, changing the world."

_And the more it seeks to rise into the height and the light, the more vigorously do its roots struggle earthward, downward, into the dark, the deep—into evil._

## Prologue - The (?) Fragility of Open Source Software

Recently, Henrik Lissner, the author of doom-emacs, after being absent for nearly half a year, spoke in the doom-emacs Discord channel:

![image](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/08/27/doom.png)

<!--more-->

The gist is:

> Hello everyone! I've been away from the project and community for about a month, dealing with family matters. If you count the health, internet, and moving issues I had last year, it's been even longer. Worse, I didn't inform you about these things in a timely manner (or give a heads-up), and I want to apologize for that. Combined with a few failed attempts over the past months, I've started to make people worry about Doom's future and its Bus Factor.
>
> To be clear: I have no intention of abandoning Doom — it's just been an unfortunate and distracting two years for me — and I hope that's behind me now.
>
> After spending a week catching up, merging PRs, and updating modules, I'll post a larger announcement on Discourse detailing the current situation, the project's direction, and how I plan to address the bus factor and communication issues going forward.
>
> In the meantime, you can find me in the #development channel; if you have any questions about the project, or have recently sent me a DM/email (and are expecting a reply), or have any PRs ready to merge or needing my attention, feel free to reach out there.

Setting aside for a moment what doom-emacs is, Henrik mentioned a very interesting term: **Bus Factor**

Wikipedia's explanation of this term is:

The Bus Factor is a measurement of the concentration of information and capability within a software project team, also known by some as the "truck factor" or "lorry factor." It refers to the number of key project members whose loss (being "hit by a bus," referring to any reason for absence such as career or lifestyle changes, marriage/childbirth, accidental injury or death, etc.) would cause the project to descend into chaos, paralysis, and ultimately fail to continue. This number is the bus factor.

A key member is interpreted as "indispensable to the project," meaning the project information they possess (e.g., design, source code, knowledge) is not widely known or shared by many other members. In a project with a high bus factor, even if someone suddenly becomes unavailable, there are many other individuals who possess sufficient relevant project information to take over their position.

A low Bus Factor is actually a common ailment of many open source software projects. If you frequent GitHub, you'll likely find many projects with high star counts abandoned due to lack of maintenance.

The most extreme example is in early 2022 when Marak, the author of the well-known open source tool Faker.js, intentionally sabotaged this open source library on GitHub, clearing all the project code and leaving the word "endgame" in a commit. As a result, front-end engineers around the world were confused to find their projects not working properly and displaying a large chunk of garbled code when they went to work that day.

_Endgame Garbled Code_

Additionally, another library he developed, colors.js, was also affected. Both of these open source software libraries are foundational pillars in front-end engineering. For instance, colors.js alone has over 20 million weekly downloads on npm (you can understand this as meaning almost anyone doing front-end work uses it).

In 2020, Marak faced the窘境 of his apartment burning down, leaving him homeless. The sponsorship he received from his open source projects was insufficient to support his daily expenses. His life became increasingly difficult, leading to the deeply regrettable and无奈 decision he made in early 2022.

_To expand on this, there are too many different views on this incident:_
_- Some believe that if you don't want big companies freeloading on your work, you should use copyleft licenses like GPL or even AGPL, which are "viral," rather than the MIT License. The MIT License grants everyone the right to use your code freely from the start. However, whether a project would have the same influence today if it used GPL is another matter (commercial companies/products typically have legal teams review open source dependencies before release to ensure there are no GPL-licensed dependencies, otherwise everything would have to be open-sourced)._
_- Others argue that the project has developed to this point with countless open source contributors adding code; it is now a collective creation of the entire open source community. You don't have the right to turn everyone's hard work into shit._
_- There are also voices supporting Marak. For example, some say these parasites have been sucking our blood for too long; at least you made them feel the pain!_
_- Some also approach it from the license angle. While people did contribute code, strictly regarding the license, this was Marak's personal project. The MIT License, after granting all rights, also absolves the author of any additional obligations. Therefore, legally speaking, Marak had every right to do this._

There are quite a few similar regrettable incidents. For example, Marak, the protagonist of the Faker.js incident, mentioned Aaron Hillel Swartz, a天才 programmer who participated in the development of the first-generation RSS, co-founded Reddit, advocated for open knowledge, and actively opposed internet piracy bills. To this end, he practiced what he preached. Using a guest account provided by the institution, he systematically downloaded academic journals from JSTOR on a large scale and made them publicly accessible. U.S. federal prosecutors subsequently indicted him on two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He rejected a plea deal proposed by federal prosecutors for six months in federal prison. Two days later, he was found dead in his apartment in Brooklyn, New York, having died by suicide.

Looking back at history, the open source spirit and open source software are perhaps one of the most incredible things of this era:

On one hand, the open source software movement and the free software movement are themselves不可思议. A group of intellectuals主动拆掉 their professional moats, often acting against commercial logic to practice the理念 of "all for one, one for all" and universal harmony. For what? Because the world should be this way, for the prosperity of the entire society, because it's cool to do so, and also because writing software itself brings无穷的乐趣 to its authors—I thought the same when I graduated: Wow, I can get paid for writing code, my life is too wonderful!

On the other hand, factually speaking, it's no exaggeration to say that open source software underpins the entire software industry today. The software industry has been彻底地改变 by open source, to the point where MIT's famous introductory computer science course, 6.001 - the famous SICP (**S**tructure and **I**nterpretation of **C**omputer **P**rograms), has now been discontinued. Professor GJS said: "Modern software engineering has become so complex that it resembles science more than engineering, because no one needs to build large systems from scratch anymore—and very few have the ability to do so."

You might感叹说, things have come to this, a group of idealists遭遇 such things, it's really the幻灭 of ideals!

**But is that really the case?**

## The Dynamics of Open Source Software

Idealism is good, but ideals must be rooted in reality to take root and sprout. Let's bring out Bourdieu's sociological theory of "field-capital-habitus" to better explain all this.

_[(Habitus) (Capital)] + Field = Social Practice_

Simply put, think of a specific thematic social space (field) created and constructed by humans as a kind of game, and each of us is a player.

As players, although we often feel like free agents on an experiential level, the various decisions we make every day are often based on foreseeable, prescribed behaviors and the attitudes of others—that is, a habitual strategy formed through interaction with the game itself—a habit (habitus).

Under the influence of this habit, we engage in博弈和斗争 according to our current position (capital), the rules of the game, and the strategies we adopt, in order to occupy a more advantageous position in this game.

The entire organism of the above subjective and objective unity constitutes (via my unprofessional summary of an extremely simplified version of) Bourdieu's worldview of social science.

Returning from the game metaphor to the real world, similarly, no one can act without some kind of interest, and the goal of that action is most likely to increase the capital one holds.

You might think, if that's the case, then how do we explain the altruistic behaviors we see in production, practice, and daily life, the奉献精神 in fields like art and science, and the open source spirit discussed in this article?

According to Bourdieu's definition, capital is not just economic capital; it should also include symbolic capital encompassing cultural capital, scientific capital, etc. Recognizing the existence of different forms of capital, Bourdieu does not believe there is any disinterested behavior in social production and life practice. From a perspective similar to game theory, he认为人的所有行为都是基于对于某种利益的计算为出发点的, to seize some form of capital—if not the economic capital we generally think of.

In different fields, different forms of capital play a dominant role—simply put, in academic circles, it's scientific capital; in art and cultural fields, it's naturally cultural capital. Different forms of capital in different fields have某种汇率, so we often see political or cultural elites leveraging their influence to acquire economic capital, and vice versa.

Here, I'd like to digress. The进步性 of Bourdieu's theory, in my view, is that all fields are created by humans, not emergent from human society. It explains why many phenomena are the way they are, while also暗示 that some seemingly entrenched ideas and social phenomena are not necessarily so. In other words, there is no purely应然的 "natural law" here, thus opening up the possibility of推翻并进步. History has not ended.

![image](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/08/27/the-end-of-the-history.jpeg)
_So you think history has ended, huh? Now I'm telling you the end of history has ended._

Returning to the topic, viewing the open source spirit within this theoretical framework can be explained as: Within the field of open source software, hackers (please note, Hackers—people who enjoy challenging problems through intelligence and creative methods, definitely not Crackers—computer criminals. The Chinese internet often confuses these two, leading to the stigmatization of the term "hacker") contribute open source code to the world in pursuit of cultural capital such as "reputation."

This is actually in line with a gift culture that often appeared in the small hunter-gatherer groups our ancestors lived in before the advent of agricultural society. Under the abundant gifts of nature, social relations were supported by this gift culture. Tribal chiefs would often engage in public acts of charity. As stated in the famous hacker culture collection *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*: Within the field of open source software, there are no very scarce "necessities of life." Early software was freely shared. This material abundance meant that the only measure of success was reputation among peers.

But hacker culture and software did not stop at a small circle of abundant resources. Unlike Professor von Neumann's prediction that "the world would need only about five computers," today, software is indeed eating the world. This is good, indicating that software plays an irreplaceably huge role in human production and life practice. On the other hand, under the influence of capitalism, the渗透 of the software industry into other industries will inevitably lead to the overlapping and融合 of fields, forcing this industry to某种程度上服从 the logic of the capitalist world—when computer technology and the software industry moved from the small-circle culture of well-off American middle-class hackers to the entire world, becoming an indispensable part of human production and life practice, the原始内核 of the open source spirit was bound to be challenged.

Therefore, open source software was destined to move from its initial utopian, pastoral idyll belonging only to a small group of technical elites to the masses,开始拥抱 the capitalism and commercial logic that supports the world's 7 billion people.

Countless histories have shown that the change from one production relationship to another is inevitably accompanied by阵痛. But as historical materialists, we do not believe that moving from the Athenian democracy of ancient Greek city-states all the way to capitalism is moving history backward. On the contrary, it is a great进步.

## The Current State of Open Source Software and Its Typical Business Models

Since the former Microsoft绞杀 the then-star software Netscape with its infamous "embrace, extend, extinguish" strategy to win the browser wars, leading to the rebirth of the Netscape browser as Mozilla Firefox (today's Firefox) and bringing about the open source movement; to the successful IPO of open source vendor RedHat in 1999; to today's "Microsoft Loves Linux" (TODO: image); to the endless stream of startups driven by open source software, I believe it can be said that at least up to today, even after embracing the capitalist commercial logic it once "despised," the open source movement is far from the word "failure."

![image](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/08/27/landscape.png)

However, open source software has indeed分化出 two different forms:

The first is the original, utopian first-generation open source software, driven by hackers starting from their own needs, writing software and open-sourcing it for more hackers to共建 together. Famous examples like Vim, Emacs, Python, Linux, PostgresQL, which have stood the test of time, have basically become symbolic标识 of open source software, revered and celebrated.

I came into contact with Emacs because I thought Notion was so good that it made me审视 my own documentation tools,进而催生了一个问题: Do I really want to entrust these note data that might accompany me for life to this商业公司 that, although红极一时, will most likely not outlive me? Then I转而有意地考察并使用了 Emacs's Org-mode for note-taking and task management, and found that for me, Org-mode is不知道高到哪里去了 compared to Notion. But such需求 is relatively small. Human demand for software is more about solving current problems faster, better, and cheaper, hence the birth of the second type of open source software.

The second is the新生, commercially-logic-driven open source software (and the商业公司 behind them) that, besides practicing the大同理念 of "all for one, one for all," treat open source as a strategic consideration and market strategy. Examples today are numerous: MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Akka, RedHat, Ubuntu, GitLab, HashiCorp stack, etc. Today, several proven, viable business models have also formed around open source software. Entrepreneurs today don't even need to convince VCs familiar with open source why open source创业有可能成功. For example:

Creating distributions or solutions around upstream core open source software, selling licenses or software subscription services in exchange for运维层面的方便 or software availability guarantees. Examples include Ubuntu, RedHat for Linux, various public cloud Kubernetes container services, and various public cloud database services (to the point that MongoDB was freeloaded so much it修改开源协议 to禁止商业竞争).

Basic features are free and open source, while advanced commercial/team features are closed-source and收费. Examples include GitLab, InfluxDB, Grafana, Envd/Modelz, HashiCorp Stack.

Providing consulting services围绕 complex, large-scale open source software like Linux, Kubernetes, PostgresQL, Prometheus.

The reason open source business models can work is that software source code does not equal all the knowledge围绕 this software: including the software's design philosophy, the history of its architectural evolution, and most importantly, the运维知识 for stable operation. This knowledge, crucial for upper-layer applications that need to run stably on it, is often only held by core developers, forming the basic logic for commercialization.

For example, it is显然是不现实的 for an enterprise whose main business is not various public cloud services to build its own cloud infrastructure from scratch, starting with building its own data center, because it needs to use technologies like cloud servers, databases, and container services, instead of using public cloud services like AWS or Alibaba Cloud.

You might ask, since the business is different and they don't care about the source code, does it even matter if the software is open source?

In these fields, if a commercial company wants to sell its own proprietary software, say, an operating system compatible with the POSIX interface protocol, they will inevitably face this质疑: How is your software better than Linux, which has been tested for 30 years? We find that nowadays, no企业试图去和 Linux compete; instead, everyone only works on differentiated parts.

I am very兴奋 about such changes in open source software and even the software industry.
Why do I say that?

## Epilogue - People's Historical View vs. Hero's Historical View

Henrik, mentioned at the beginning of the article, is undoubtedly the继承者 of that star-studded utopian era in today's world, an absolute意义上的英雄. It was the doom-emacs written by Henrik that gave me, a Vimer, a foothold in the world of Emacs, and even provided a文档编写体验比 Notion 还好不少. It was Henrik who led me to discover the神奇的 NixOS,从此彻底告别 the endless system configuration and painful rollbacks.

Although regarding this小小风波 of the Bus Factor, Henrik stated he would绝对不会放弃 Doom-emacs and promised to give the community an交代. But sooner or later, heroes总会迟暮. When that time comes, how should we, who follow in the footsteps of heroes, proceed?

![image](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/08/27/motoko.jpeg)
_The net is vast and infinite. I really like the ending where Motoko disappears into the network. The audience doesn't need Motoko as an idol, and Motoko doesn't need to束缚自己 with her self._

In the field of documentation, from the繁荣社区 of emacs / org-mode, useful documentation tools and startups like LogSeq (seed round $4.1M) have站起来了. In the shadow of Notion, open-source明星团队 like AFFiNE (Pre-A round tens of millions of dollars in funding) have also been born.

Similar things are now层出不穷 in various fields of the software industry. And all of this is built upon the坚实基础设施 laid down by generations of open source software and idealist前辈. The giants of this industry can almost no longer轻松地垄断 an entire industry like they could twenty years ago. I believe that the further improvement of infrastructure will, in the future, break the false神谕 of精细化的社会分工. Everyone will be able to freely use these tools to do something interesting.

Although heroes may fade, unlike some other tragedies in history, the people within the field of open source software have not betrayed the heroes. On the contrary, they have truly改变并改造了这个世界 along the path开创 by the heroes. Today, Microsoft, once the "enemy" of open source software, has become a践行者 of open source software and the open source movement.

The move of open source software from the象牙塔 of universities to the embrace of capital is历史的必然. The ideal of the open source spirit has not磨灭 with this transformation. On the contrary, it has催生出 a崭新世界 where people do not place all their hopes on heroes. May our ideals, like open source software, take root and sprout in solid ground,伴 with the world's污泥,从中吸取养料,茁壮成长, and grow into towering trees.
