# Ascending the Yuedu Pavilion

Peaks gather like a crowd, waves rage like fury, the road to Tongguan lies between mountains and rivers.

From the Yuedu Pavilion, the entire eight-hundred-li Qin Plain unfolds before the eyes:

Behold—the crisscrossing paths, the sounds of chickens and dogs, favorable weather and fertile land, a place blessed with outstanding people!

Here, one gazes north at the grandeur of the Loess Plateau and faces south the imposing Qinling Mountains and Mount Hua. Nourished by the mighty, surging Wei River, it has fostered the brilliant and magnificent civilization of China!

May we rise with the rooster's crow, carrying forward the past and opening up the future!

How fortunate I am to express my aspirations in song.
