On the last day of May, I realized Bryan was gone.

<!--more-->

There is no evidence to prove Bryan's departure. We didn't need a farewell, so there is no exact time for his leaving.

I realized this on my way home from work. That night, I was walking across from Tsinghua University. It was past ten, and the bike shed was probably locked, so I decided to leave my bike at the office and follow my late-night routine: orange juice, music loud enough to drown out the street noise, and a touch of leisure. After about two hundred meters, passing the only spot on Tsinghua East Road where you can see the full moon, the thought crept into my mind—Bryan seems to have left.

On my way downstairs, I saw two people casually sitting cross-legged on the marble platform next to the stone lions at the building entrance, chatting as if holding drinks. I only dared to glance; a direct gaze might be impolite, or perhaps they wouldn't care even if I stared. But at least I had to protect the rare image of these two people in my mind. What were they talking about? Was it about the present, the past, or the future? Was it an unexpected encounter, or were they keeping a not-too-distant appointment? I had no way of knowing. I turned and walked into the convenience store, toasting them from afar with my orange juice.

Tsinghua East Road, as I've observed, has a slight incline—or, according to S, it just feels easier to walk home because there's always a bit of resistance to going to work. My attention shifted to the depths of my mind, pondering another farewell I never received, and the reason my roommate left without saying goodbye. We had discussed renewing the lease early on, and the conclusion was that he would move out. Unexpectedly, on that morning when I woke up, my roommate, who had just played Plants vs. Zombies with me the night before, had vanished along with all traces of his life. It was hard not to wonder if I had done something wrong, to imagine what he would have done if I were his true friend. But from the premise of his leaving without a word, it was clear I wasn't a qualified friend, and that was deeply saddening.

But deep down, I couldn't ignore the bigger premise—we were indeed true friends. Because hearts aren't made of stone. Even someone as introverted as my roommate, who was always afraid of causing trouble and kept to himself, could be moved by life. Those late-night discussions that started with technology but expanded to technology itself, people, and the world; those interesting logical traps and puzzles: what is the contrapositive of "不到长城非好汉" ("He who has never been to the Great Wall is not a true man")? We assumed we were machines, trying to think from a mechanical logic perspective, and often ended up staying up until three or four in the morning, only to repeat the same mistake the next day. Or the simple greetings, or the walks. All of these at least fulfilled my own definition of friendship. Even though you can never truly know what another person is thinking, based on past experiences, the other person would only engage in such behaviors if they shared the same thoughts.

**I thought, perhaps I would receive a letter, or a foreseeable farewell.**

There was no uncertainty; I would wait for that letter forever.

At this point, I began to feel certain that Bryan, as an independent person, had completely disappeared. I could find no trace of him in my mind.

Memories of Bryan also grew hazy. He always seemed to carry a certain melancholy, different from mine—his was purer, with no specific reason. Perhaps he enjoyed this moon-like sorrow, the loneliness that simmered in his chest like a slow-burning fire. Or maybe it was a ritual for him, a way to cleanse his soul through melancholy.

Bryan's last story happened a few days ago when the electromagnetic door downstairs wouldn't open. He was holding a bag of trash, ready to go out and throw it away, then buy himself a bag of whole-grain bread from the bakery for dinner—I had been at home all afternoon. Bryan repeatedly pressed the door switch, but it didn't work. He tried pushing the door with his body, but it was useless, not even making much noise—just a dull thud.

The logic is simple: for example, if we have ample supplies, we can stay at home for ten days or half a month without going out. But once we know the door is locked from the outside, the taste of freedom becomes irresistibly tempting. At that point, staying at home for even an hour feels unbearable. Even if it means jumping out of a window, we must go out—there's no room for negotiation. Bryan was the same. The thought of just eating something at home crossed his mind, but simply because the door was broken, he had to go out. **Going out became the only reason, motivation, and purpose.** Dinner was no longer important.

So Bryan heard the crows cawing outside, as if he had become one of them. He went to the stairwell between the first and second floors, opened the window to freedom. The window was small, only big enough for him to squeeze through, but Bryan felt as happy as if he were flying. On the second-floor platform, gripping the security bars, Bryan imagined himself as a seasoned explorer, stretching his foot to find a foothold. The final step was stepping onto the mailbox of the building unit, then jumping down, breathing in the freedom as real as the air. I took out my key and tentatively tried to open the door from the outside. It opened. I picked up the trash and embarked on my quest for dinner.

That night, I witnessed such a magnificent sunset.

I finally received that email from my roommate—his apologies and gratitude, the entire message a testament to our friendship. After 211 days as roommates, I was considered a warm person, a qualified friend. After about a year of reflection and self-cultivation, and recent signs, Bryan, as the alter ego I used to escape my negative emotions, has disappeared. The event that gave birth to Bryan many years ago and had long tormented me as Bryan ultimately made me a more authentic and composed person.

Frank Lloyd Wright's words can serve as the final judgment on the entire Bryan incident:

> Unconscious hypocrisy is terrible enough, but for any creative artist, conscious hypocrisy will more ruthlessly erode their soul. No coward can create a work of art. I once believed this, and I still hold it true today.

Finally, to summarize: earlier in the text, I mentioned that I couldn't see my own path but wasted effort on trivial skills. Now I realize that no matter what goals I have, all my efforts are aimed at becoming a better person—someone emotionally stable, clear-minded, self-aware, focused, and **abundant**. The conclusion from my graduation still holds true:

> I anticipate that the life ahead will still be full of opportunities to make benign mistakes and moments of making no mistakes at all. The process may not be easy or pleasant, but it is absolutely fascinating.

And life is indeed like skiing: turn left, turn right, or think about it and die. We not only possess life; we are also possessed by it.
