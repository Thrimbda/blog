## Hello

I've finally mustered some interest to renovate my long-neglected blog.

As of 2024, my life is at a stage where the urge to express can be quickly and easily released offline. Although I often have many things I want to write about, spending time writing articles feels slightly extravagant for me. So, I've been too lazy to maintain my own blog. And wouldn't you know it, Hexo's CI just broke, so I'm taking this opportunity to switch to something new.

That is, here.

After briefly looking into NextJS, Gatsby, and Hexo, and to avoid wasting this fleeting urge to tinker with the blog, I ultimately chose the single-binary static site generator Zola. I didn't do any in-depth research, but it genuinely meets my current needs:

1.  Write in Markdown.
2.  As long as this binary exists, I should still be able to publish via CI ten years from now, without build failures due to overly outdated dependencies (looking at you, Hexo).
3.  The theme is simple enough that even I can easily maintain it.

Maybe in the future, if I have time to tinker, I'll try creating a more flexible and flashy blog. But for now, this is it.

Looking back at an article I wrote years ago when I first set up my blog, it still feels quite interesting, so I'll leave it here.

> After returning to school and tinkering with my half-dead website, I started thinking about the personal blog I've been coveting for a long time. I used to rush to register on JianShu because it supported markdown. After writing one or two casual essays, I still felt there were too many restrictions, too little freedom—you could say I was nitpicking. Seeing A-Zheng's blog[^1] thriving, I immediately felt that I, Tu Yang, still needed to learn a thing or two.

## Footnotes

[^1]: A-Zheng said: "Who keeps a diary these days!" Although his blog link is now dead, fortunately, he's lazy enough that he hasn't deleted the source code. So, if you're interested, you can still take a look: [zccz14's Blog](https://github.com/zccz14/blog/tree/master/src/posts), but that might change once he sees this article.
