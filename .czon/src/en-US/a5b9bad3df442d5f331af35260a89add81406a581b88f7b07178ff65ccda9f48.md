What does travel mean to me?

For some, travel means conquest. Knowing in advance where to go, roughly what to do, and then checking off destinations and achieving milestones.

For me, travel means seeking. There is no physical endpoint; the incompleteness that arises from leaving home becomes the driving force to move forward during the journey. Carrying this sense of lack, I search for what my heart is missing. I don’t know what it is, but whatever it is will be the endpoint of this trip. Endpoints are rare, so my travels are often accompanied by anxiety—a longing for the endpoint and the accompanying fear of never reaching it.

Recording a long-awaited trip.

## The Journey Out - A Twisted Start

The car’s battery showed 0%, with 0 kilometers remaining. At this point, the three of us were still 4 kilometers away from Pudong Airport, with only 9 minutes left before the check-in counter closed. To make matters worse, Brother Ji suddenly realized he had brought his old passport by mistake...

In the end, only Ah Zheng and I boarded the flight to Chiang Mai. Even after boarding, we were still shaken. I’ve never believed in bad luck, but today was indeed not smooth sailing.

We were still working before departure, and as a result, we paid a high price for a critical mistake—this was the start of the troubles. After a brief review, we realized we had misjudged the time it would take to get from home to Pudong Airport. Unhurriedly, we set off for Pudong—driving, with a designated driver taking the car back home afterward.

When we turned on the navigation in the car, we discovered it would take an hour and a half longer than expected. In other words, if the navigation’s time estimate was accurate, we would just miss check-in. There was no leisurely driving with Nomi’s autopilot; the only way out was to drive boldly and carefully ourselves, despite unfavorable factors like traffic jams, rainy weather, and low battery. We had to speed as much as possible while ensuring safety, trying to gain about five minutes.

After more than an hour of frantic driving, we did manage to gain some time, arriving at the scene described at the beginning.

After boarding the plane, I felt somewhat exhausted, as if I had lost my keen sensitivity to life. In the past few hours, I had experienced the frustration of a work mistake, the tension and excitement of rushing to catch a flight, and the regret of a companion not making it. Yet, for the upcoming trip, I hadn’t felt even a hint of anticipation. Thinking about it, this sense of anticipation for travel seemed to have been absent from my life for a long time.

I turned on airplane mode and drifted into a drowsy sleep. When I picked up my phone again, an hour had passed. Only then did I see a message from Playground sent an hour earlier, roughly saying that an important matter had finally been resolved as hoped. A warm feeling, like black tea, slowly flowed into my heart. Empathy began to work its magic, and I finally relaxed, letting out a long sigh.

So, what would happen in the coming days? Roughly two days in Chiang Mai and four days in Bangkok, though aside from the two nights’ accommodation in Chiang Mai, flights and hotels were still unbooked. Amid this chaos, I began to feel a glimmer of anticipation for this trip.

## Songkran Festival

Our trip happened to coincide with the Songkran Festival, the grandest celebration for the Dai-Thai ethnic groups across Southeast Asia. It carries a beautiful meaning: washing away the dust of the past year and starting anew for the coming year.

After resting and preparing for a night, we met up with Brother Ji’s friends (though he himself couldn’t make it due to the mishap). This was the first day of Songkran. Brother Ji’s friends had rented a pickup truck, equipped with two large buckets of water, three water guns for long-range attacks, and four or five small buckets for close combat.

Approaching the moat near the old city, we arrived at a corner of the main battlefield—a scene of chaos I had never seen before: people were in disarray, everyone using every suitable container to splash water at others. The ample supply of ice turned the otherwise harmless lukewarm water into refreshingly cold water. People joyfully shouted as they splashed each other.

![image0](https://0xc1.space/images/2024/04/19/fighting_people.jpg)

Boys and girls on the streets indiscriminately drenched every passing object with water guns, buckets, and various other “weapons.” Street vendors either sold food or ice and water for refills (mostly scooped directly from the river), and they themselves joined in the splashing. No one could resist the revelry of Songkran. Passersby on bikes could only be splashed, at best managing to pull out their small water guns to retaliate futilely during brief lulls in the attacks.

The main force was countless pickup trucks like ours, slowly advancing on severely congested roads. On these trucks, regardless of age or gender, people were either doing their best to spray everyone or being joyfully drenched with ice-cold water, only to snap back and retaliate seconds later. Some trucks had built-in speakers, so the people on them swayed passionately to the rhythm, completely unfazed by the water being splashed at them. Nearly ten people swaying in unison made the truck itself seem to bounce up and down as if it were dancing.

Everyone was laughing and shouting—a true carnival for all.

Unfortunately, we had to stop midway. On one hand, the scorching sun quickly gave us sunburns; on the other, after I went to bed early the previous night, Ah Zheng and the others bought afternoon tickets to Bangkok—perhaps thinking Chiang Mai was just a simple appetizer, while Bangkok had everything more captivating. I had no strong opinion, only feeling that Songkran was already fun enough.

As it turned out, we were all somewhat mistaken.

After a difficult two-kilometer trek under the blazing sun, we finally left the heavily congested area and took a taxi back to the homestay.

After a hot shower and changing into dry clothes, while packing our bags to head to Bangkok, Ah Zheng realized his phone was missing.

## City Chase

I called Ah Zheng’s phone several times before confirming it wasn’t in the room.

Anxiety surged. Losing a phone in a foreign country where you don’t speak the language and trying to recover it is no easy task. To make matters worse, we were about to leave for the airport, and time was very, very tight.

At first, we thought it might have been left in the ride-hailing car, so we called customer service. However, the客服 couldn’t reach the driver who had taken us back, forcing us to think of other solutions.

Time ticked away, and we still had no clue how to find the phone. Should we call the police? Would that even help?

Got it! Let’s try iPhone’s Find My feature. About every two minutes, Ah Zheng could see his phone’s location updated on the Find My app on his Mac. The latest location was just north of Chiang Mai’s old city. We decided to take a taxi and head to where his phone was, hoping for some luck. A strange mirror image emerged: I used my phone as a hotspot, and he held his laptop. We ventured out in clothes not suited for getting wet.

Midway, the driver dropped us off, unwilling to enter the severe congestion. One holding a phone, the other a laptop, we advanced like two madmen toward the constantly changing location.

We were definitely going to miss the flight, but fortunately, the homestay was booked for two days, so we could stay another night.

Midway, I received a call—from Ah Zheng’s number. But after answering, all I could hear was street noise, as if it was an accidental touch. This suggested the person who found the phone wasn’t a thief, as a thief would have turned it off and wouldn’t make such a mistake.

We were getting closer. Ah Zheng’s phone wasn’t moving as if in a vehicle; we could keep up by running. The phone left the main road and entered a small alley.

Finally, in front of a phone shop in the alley, we intercepted the scavenger uncle who had picked up the phone. The phone case was already gone. I guess we’ll never know whether the uncle intended to sell the phone or hand it over to the more knowledgeable phone shop to fulfill the act of returning lost property. Regardless, Ah Zheng expressed gratitude and gave some money to thank the uncle.

The feeling of recovering something lost is incredible! Once again, I experienced the vividness of life in an adventure given by life itself. Ah Zheng was also incredibly excited—I’d never seen someone so happy about missing a flight.

## Zoe in Yellow

The moment we found the phone, to celebrate, Ah Zheng suggested grabbing a drink. So, I looked up bars in the city and found one that seemed decent, called Zoe in Yellow. I immediately imagined what kind of place it might be.

In that instant, the future revealed its朦胧的面纱 to me.

However, the direction into the city was filled with疯狂的泼水狂徒, eager to evenly drench everyone in sight. Pleading with gestures was useless. Looking at my freshly changed clothes and shoes, I quickly extinguished that momentary anticipation and returned to a rational state, deciding not to go.

After resting back at the homestay and rebooking tickets for an early morning flight to Bangkok the next day (but skipping dinner), my companions decided to head into the city for some fun. As for me, my stomach was growling with hunger, and I really wasn’t in the mood, so I prepared to head back.

After parting ways with my companions, I tiredly hailed a Grab motorbike to return to the Maya Plaza near the homestay for some food, then head back to sleep early.

According to my original plan, I shouldn’t have taken a motorbike. The呼啸而过的晚风, combined with water splashed by pedestrians along the way, washed away my fatigue.

My clothes were溅湿 in the漫天水花. Amid the摩托轰响的引擎声, I collided with the暖洋洋的风. On this early summer night, I shook my hair, leaving a few water droplets in the wind, and the wind returned a hint of清凉 as thanks.

Perhaps because the Songkran Festival is like a contagious狂欢病毒—before getting splashed, I was a civilized, decent person concerned about my neat, dry clothes. But after getting wet, I only wanted to join the纵情狂欢的人群 and make the next civilized person concerned about their decent clothes join my ranks. It wasn’t even 9 p.m., the timing was perfect; I had just entered the city, the location was perfect. I immediately decided to change course and head to Zoe.

It was like a shy introvert being dragged to a party by a confident extrovert friend. People tried to talk to the introvert, but he could only awkwardly smile, while his extrovert friend loudly introduced his shy friend to the crowd. Except both were me—a somewhat schizophrenic, awkward me, wanting to狂欢却又有点放不开.

Standing at the entrance of Zoe, I heard震天的音乐声 inside. Surrounding the dance floor was a circle of小吃商铺 and bars. I decided to fill my stomach first, maybe have a drink or two.

People were so joyful. After finishing a gin and tonic, I was射了个满怀 by a nearby foreigner with a water gun. Damn it! I’ve had enough of human form, enough of being a normal, polite human, enough of rationality. To hell with it—today is for狂欢.

I entered the dance floor,小心翼翼 at first,辗转腾挪, but inevitably getting照顾到 by water guns from all directions.
Once on the dance floor, the sprinklers above worked like heavy rain, evenly rinsing everyone.

But how do you蹦? This was my first time actually going to a蹦迪 as someone who doesn’t dance. Just sway to the rhythm! Everyone was doing their own thing; I wasn’t performing on stage, so there was nothing to be shy about, I comforted myself.

In front of me, slightly to the side, was a white couple. They embraced and swayed to the rhythm, as if the entire dance floor, or the whole world, consisted only of the two of them,圆满地摇摆着. My heart felt a slight悸动. Was I渴望这样的互动吗?

Closing my eyes, I danced clumsily to the rhythm, still awkward, still shy.

![image1](https://0xc1.space/images/2024/04/19/dance_in_the_water.jpg)

When I opened my eyes again, this girl with blue braids and a black baseball cap appeared beside me.

—“She dances so freely.”
That was the first thought. She was背对着 the DJ booth, facing the opposite direction of everyone else, dancing肆意地,优雅且具备力量. It was a kind of自由的力量, as if the world consisted only of the music’s rhythm and her dancing body. Then I caught a glimpse of her head raised slightly due to her舞步.

—“She’s so beautiful.”
The second thought迸发出来. Water droplets on her face were like dewdrops in the morning light,晶莹剔透; her slightly arched eyebrows like willow leaves, with wide-set大眼睛 beneath them, reminiscent of a silver fox; her极富异域风情的眸子 seemed to possess a奇妙的力量, making one不由自主地沉醉其中. Under the恰到好处的法令纹, her mouth appeared优雅而大气, as if a精心雕琢的艺术品,微微张开, revealing a从容不迫的气息. In her自信的笑容,酒窝若隐若现, like a璀璨星辰 hidden in the night sky,悄然闪耀.

In the声浪 exceeding 100 dB, the world fell silent. I myself became半透明似的, with only this girl dancing肆意而自由 under a single spotlight. It was as if she were the embodiment of music, perfectly融合在一起 with the rhythm. Her blue braids swayed gently with her舞步, like一道道蓝色的波浪划过 the air. Her black baseball cap tilted slightly, adding a touch of不羁和神秘.

I was deeply吸引 by her舞姿, as if time stood still at that moment. Every shrug of her shoulders, every jump, seemed like精心编排的舞蹈, filled with奇异的美感. Her face radiated自信和快乐, that纯粹的享受和自由的表达, like a重拳打在我的心头.

On this喧嚣的夜晚, she became the唯一的焦点 in my eyes. Her presence made everything around her黯然失色, with only her舞步 and the music’s节奏 echoing in the air. I felt as if I could sense her内心的激情和自由, that不受束缚、尽情释放的感觉.

I wanted to join her自由的舞步 and enjoy this纯粹的快乐 together.

As the music reached its高潮, her舞步 became more激烈和狂野. Her body swayed freely with the rhythm, every movement filled with力量和美感. Her eyes闪烁光芒, as if telling her story and dreams. Her raised right hand敲击着空气, as if the air itself had become an instrument, its声浪 echoing in the dance floor,撞击着每个人的胸腔, making them forget their names, becoming dancing machines.

Then she was拉走 by friends, and I was拽回到了热闹的舞池中.

In the center of the dance floor,暴雨一般的喷水器 sent凉爽 into the crowd. I was彻底湿透了 and彻底兴奋起来了.

Inspired by her, I also began to自由起来, no longer拘泥于 my own舞步, no longer worried about others’目光. Letting my body sway freely with the music’s节奏, gradually自信而有力. I felt an前所未有的自由和快乐, as if the whole world were cheering for me.

I was no longer an旁观者 but had become part of the music. In the节奏, I奔涌着,怒号着,肆意流淌着, like洪水般要毁灭沿途的一切. Making all meaningful symbols消解、融化 into it, joining this汹涌之中,壮大 it, until the world would consist only of the music’s节奏 and my不成章法, yet无敌的舞步.

Then, she appeared beside me again, still swaying freely and不顾旁人地, but now with a small bucket of加冰块、冒着泡的饮料 in hand.

Whether it was my错觉 or not, we became a奇妙的双星系统. No matter how people pushed their way into or out of the dance floor, she始终 swayed in front of me.

As the night deepened, people gradually got into the mood,涌入愈加拥挤的舞池之中, and our distance也因此而变得更近了.

碰撞,溅出水滴 in the瓢泼“大雨”; her hat touched my chin. “Put your fucking hands up,” the DJ on stage said, and her高举着的手 in the节奏 touched mine.

She turned around, tucked the drink under her arm,双手合十半蹲了一下, saying sorry with羞涩的笑意 in her eyes, as明媚柔和 as黄昏.

She handed me the bucket of酒 with the straw facing me. It tasted like rum mixed with cola. In return, I gave her a hug—something I had wanted to do all along.

And thus, I experienced that强烈的冲击.

---

This冲击 pierced my chest like a长枪, puncturing the rational symbolic force field. Beneath it,汹涌的爱欲 erupted like a火山爆发, trying to catch this外来者 that had雷霆万钧之力戳入我的精神领域. The炙热的波涛努力变换ing形态, attempting to修补 the already incomplete force field, trying to capture even a hint of理性和意义, trying to establish a可被理解的形象 for her. This不自觉却又过载运行的努力 failed. I felt so tired.

It穿透了所有的表象, entered the本体的虚无之中, forming a奇点, where it began its永恒的圆周运动, and would be赋予时间性 in the
