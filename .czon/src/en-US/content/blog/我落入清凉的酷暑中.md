What does travel mean to me?

For some, travel means conquest. Knowing in advance where to go, roughly what to do, then checking off locations and achieving goals.

For me, travel means seeking. There is no physical destination; the incompleteness born from leaving home becomes the driving force to move forward. Carrying this sense of lack, I search for what my heart is missing. I don't know what it is, but whatever it is will be the endpoint of this journey. Endpoints are rare, so my travels are often accompanied by anxiety—a longing for the endpoint, and the accompanying fear of never reaching it.

Recording a long-awaited journey.

## The Journey Out - A Bumpy Start

The car's battery showed 0%, range 0 km. At that moment, the three of us were still 4 km from Pudong Airport, with 9 minutes left before check-in closed. To make matters worse, Brother Ji suddenly realized he had brought his old passport by mistake...

In the end, only Ah Zheng and I boarded the plane to Chiang Mai. Even after boarding, our hearts were still pounding. I've never believed in bad luck, but today was indeed not smooth sailing.

We were still working right before departure, and we paid a high price for a critical mistake—that was the inauspicious start. After a quick review, we had misjudged the time needed to get from home to Pudong Airport and set off leisurely—driving, then having a designated driver take the car home.

Upon starting the navigation, we found the trip would take an hour and a half longer than expected. If the estimate was accurate, we would miss check-in. Relying on Nomi's autopilot for a relaxed drive was impossible. The only way out was to drive boldly yet carefully ourselves, despite traffic jams, rain, and low battery, speeding as much as possible while staying safe to gain about five minutes.

After over an hour of frantic driving, we did gain time, arriving at the scene described at the beginning.

On the plane, I felt somewhat exhausted, as if I had lost my keen sensitivity to life. In the past few hours, I had experienced the frustration of a work error, the tension and excitement of rushing for a flight, and the regret of a companion not making it. Yet, for the upcoming trip, I hadn't felt a shred of anticipation. Thinking about it, this sense of travel anticipation seemed to have been absent from my life for a long time.

I turned on airplane mode and drifted into a drowsy sleep. Picking up my phone again an hour later, I saw a message from Playground sent an hour ago,大意是 a significant recent matter had finally been resolved as hoped. A warmth, tasting like black tea, slowly flowed into my heart. Empathy began to work, and I finally relaxed, letting out a long sigh.

So, what would happen in the coming days? Roughly two days in Chiang Mai, then four in Bangkok. Except for the two nights in Chiang Mai, flights and hotels weren't booked. Amid this chaos, I began to feel a flicker of anticipation for this trip.

## Songkran

Our trip coincided with Songkran, the grandest festival for the Dai-Thai ethnic groups across Southeast Asia. It carries a beautiful寓意: washing away the dust of the past year and starting anew for the coming year.

After resting and preparing for a night, we met up with Brother Ji's friends (though he himself couldn't make it due to the mishap). It was the first day of Songkran. Brother Ji's friends had rented a pickup truck. On the cargo bed were two large barrels of water, three water guns for long-range attacks, and four or five small buckets for close combat.

Approaching the moat near the old city, we reached a corner of the main battlefield. It was a scene of chaos I had never seen before: people in disarray, everyone using every suitable container to splash water on others. The ample supply of ice turned the otherwise harmless lukewarm water into refreshingly icy water. People joyfully shouted and splashed each other.

![image0](https://0xc1.space/images/2024/04/19/fighting_people.jpg)

Boys and girls on the streets indiscriminately drenched every object passing by with water guns, buckets, and various other "weapons." Street vendors either sold food or ice and water for refills (mostly scooped straight from the river), and they themselves joined in the splashing. No one could resist the狂欢 of Songkran. Passersby on bikes could only be splashed; at best, they could pull out their own small water guns during lulls in the assault to retaliate futilely.

The main force was countless pickup trucks like ours, inching forward on severely congested roads. On the trucks, regardless of age or gender, people were either尽力 spraying water at everyone or being joyfully drenched with ice water,嗷嗷大叫, then snapping back to retaliate seconds later. Some trucks had their own speakers, so people on them swayed passionately to the rhythm, utterly不在意 how much water was thrown at them. Nearly ten people swaying in unison on the truck made it seem like the vehicle itself was bouncing to the music.

Everyone was laughing and shouting. It was a true狂欢 for all.

Unfortunately, we had to stop midway. On one hand, the blazing sun quickly gave us sunburns. On the other hand, after I went to bed early the previous night, Ah Zheng and the others bought tickets to Bangkok for the afternoon—大概 thinking Chiang Mai was just a simple appetizer, while Bangkok held all the more captivating attractions. I was noncommittal,只是觉得 Songkran was already fun enough.

As it turned out, we were all somewhat mistaken.

After a difficult two-kilometer trek under the scorching sun, we finally left the heavily congested area and took a taxi back to the民宿.

After a hot shower and changing into dry clothes, while packing to head to Bangkok, Ah Zheng realized his phone was missing.

## Urban Chase

I called Ah Zheng's phone several times before confirming it wasn't in the room.

Anxiety surged. Losing a phone in a foreign country with a language barrier isn't easy to resolve. To make matters worse, we were about to leave for the airport—time was very, very tight.

Initially thinking it was left in the ride-hailing car, we called customer service, but they couldn't reach the driver who took us back either. We had to think of other办法.

Time ticked away. We still had no clue how to find the phone. Report to the police? Would that help?

Got it! Try iPhone's Find My功能. About every two minutes, Ah Zheng could see his phone's location update on the Find My app on his Mac. The latest location was a bit north of Chiang Mai's old city. We decided to take a taxi and head to his phone's location to try our luck. A bizarre mirror image appeared: I held my phone with hotspot on, he held his laptop, and we went out in clothes not suited for getting wet.

Midway, the driver, unwilling to enter the severe congestion, dropped us off. One holding a phone, the other a laptop, we advanced like two madmen toward the constantly changing location.

We were definitely missing the flight. Fortunately, the民宿 was booked for two days, so we could stay another night.

Mid-chase, I received a call—from Ah Zheng's number. But upon answering,除了 street noise, nothing was audible. It seemed like an accidental touch. This meant the person who found the phone wasn't a thief, as a thief would turn it off and wouldn't make such a mistake.

Getting closer. Ah Zheng's phone wasn't moving at car speed; we could keep up running. The phone left the main road and entered a small alley.

Finally, in front of a phone shop in the alley, we intercepted the scavenger uncle who had found the phone. The phone case was already gone. I guess we'll never know if the uncle intended to sell the phone or let the more phone-savvy shop complete the act of returning lost property. Regardless, Ah Zheng expressed thanks and gave some money to the uncle.

Retrieving what was lost felt so good! Once again, I felt the vividness of life in an adventure given by生活. Ah Zheng was also incredibly excited—never seen someone so happy about missing a flight.

## Zoe in Yellow

The moment we found the phone, to celebrate, Ah Zheng suggested getting a drink. So I looked up bars in the city. One seemed quite good, called Zoe in Yellow. I随即 imagined what kind of place that might be.

In that instant, the future revealed its朦胧 veil to me.

However, the direction into the city was filled with疯狂泼水狂徒,渴望均匀淋湿 everyone in sight. Pleading with gestures was useless. Looking at my freshly changed clothes and shoes, I swiftly扑灭 that flicker of anticipation and returned to理智, deciding not to go.

Back at the民宿, we rested, rebooked tickets to Bangkok for early the next morning (but didn't eat). Later, my companions decided to go into the city for some fun. I, joining them, was so hungry my stomach growled,实在提不起兴趣,准备打道回府.

After parting with my companions, tired, I booked a Grab motorbike to return to the Maya shopping mall near the民宿 for food, then head back to sleep early.

According to my original plan, I shouldn't have taken the motorbike. The呼啸而过的晚风, mixed with water splashed by pedestrians on the road, washed away my fatigue.

My clothes were溅湿 in the漫天水花. Amid the摩托轰响引擎声, I collided with the暖洋洋的风. On this early summer night, I甩了甩头发, leaving a few water droplets in the wind, and the wind returned a丝清凉 as thanks.

Perhaps because Songkran is like a contagious狂欢病毒. Before getting splashed, I was a civilized, decent person在意着自己的整洁干爽衣衫. But after getting wet, I just wanted to join the纵情狂欢人群,让下一个在意自己衣服体面的文明人 join my ranks. Not yet 9 PM, the timing was正好; just entered the city, the location was正好. I当即决定改道去 Zoe.

Like a shy introvert dragged to a party by a confident extrovert friend, people try to talk to the introvert, who can only awkwardly smile, while his extrovert friend loudly introduces his shy friend to the crowd. Except both were me—a bit分裂的,别扭的我, wanting to狂欢却又有点放不开.

Standing at the entrance of Zoe, I heard震天音乐声 inside. Surrounding the dance floor was a circle of小吃商铺 and bars. I decided to fill my stomach first, maybe have a drink or two.

People were so快活. After a gin and tonic, I was射了个满怀 by a nearby foreigner with a water gun. Damn it! I'm tired of the human form, tired of being a normal, polite human, tired of理性. To hell with it, today is for狂欢.

I entered the dance floor, first小心翼翼,辗转腾挪, but inevitably got照顾到 by water guns from all directions.
Once on the dance floor, the sprinklers above worked like heavy rain, evenly rinsing everyone.

But how to dance? This was my first time真正去蹦迪 as someone who can't dance. Just sway to the rhythm! Everyone was doing their own thing; I wasn't performing on stage, nothing to be shy about, I comforted myself.

斜前方, this white couple embraced, swaying to the rhythm as if the entire dance floor, or the whole world, consisted only of the two of them,圆满地摇摆着. My heart felt a丝悸动. Was I渴望这样的互动吗?

Closing my eyes, dancing瞎跳 to the rhythm, still笨拙, still羞涩.

![image1](https://0xc1.space/images/2024/04/19/dance_in_the_water.jpg)

When I opened my eyes again, this girl with blue braids and a black baseball cap appeared beside me.

—"She dances so freely."
The first thought said. She faced away from the DJ booth, opposite everyone else, dancing肆意,优雅且具备力量. It was a power of freedom, as if the world contained only the music's rhythm and her own dancing body. Then I caught a glimpse of her head raised by her舞步.

—"She's so beautiful."
The second thought迸发出来. Water droplets on her face were like dewdrops in the morning晨曦,晶莹剔透; her slightly arched eyebrows like willow leaves, the wide-set大眼睛 beneath like a silver fox; her极富异域风情的眸子 seemed to possess a奇妙的力量, making one不由自主地沉醉其中.修饰ed by恰到好处的法令纹, her mouth appeared优雅而大气, as if a精心雕琢的艺术品,微微张开,透露出一种从容不迫的气息. In her自信的笑容,酒窝若隐若现,仿佛是夜晚星空中藏匿的一颗璀璨星辰,悄然闪耀.

In over 100 dB of声浪, the world quieted down. I myself became半透明似的. Only this girl danced肆意而自由 under a single spotlight. As if she were the embodiment of music, perfectly融合 with the rhythm. Her blue braids swayed gently with her舞步, like一道道蓝色的波浪在空中划过. Her black baseball cap tilted slightly, adding a touch of不羁和神秘.

I was deeply吸引ed by her舞姿, as if time stood still. Every shrug of her shoulders, every jump, seemed like精心编排的舞蹈, filled with奇异的美感. Her face radiated自信和快乐, that纯粹的享受和自由的表达,仿佛一记重拳打在我的心头.

In this喧嚣夜晚, she became the only焦点 in my eyes. Her existence made everything around黯然失色. Only her舞步 and the music's rhythm echoed in the air. I仿佛能够感受到她内心的激情和自由,那种不受束缚、尽情释放的感觉.

I wanted to join her自由的舞步,一起享受这份纯粹的快乐.

As the music climaxed, her舞步 became more激烈和狂野. Her body swayed freely with the rhythm, every movement filled with力量和美感. Her eyes闪烁ed with光芒,仿佛在诉说着她的故事和梦想. Her高举的右手敲击着空气, as if the air itself became an instrument, its声浪回荡ing in the dance floor,撞击着每个人的胸腔, making them forget their own names, becoming dancing machines.

Then she was pulled away by friends, and I was拽回到了热闹的舞池中.

In the center of the dance floor,暴雨一般的喷水器 sent凉爽 into the crowd. I was彻底湿透了,也彻底兴奋起来了.

Inspired by her, I also began to自由起来, no longer拘泥于自己的舞步,不再担心别人的目光. Letting my body sway freely with the music's rhythm,逐步自信而有力. I felt an前所未有的自由和快乐,仿佛整个世界都在为我欢呼.

I was no longer an旁观者, but became part of the music. In the rhythm,奔涌着,怒号着,肆意流淌着,仿佛洪水般要毁灭沿途的一切. Making all meaningful symbols消解、融化于其中,加入这股汹涌之中,使之壮大.最终, the world would只剩下音乐的节奏 and my不成章法,却又无敌的舞步.

Then, she appeared beside me again, still swaying那样自由地、不顾旁人地,只是手上多了一小桶加了冰块、冒着泡的饮料.

不知是否是我的错觉, we became a奇妙的双星系统.任凭人们推搡着进入或者离开舞池, she始终在我的前方摇摆着.

The night grew deeper. People gradually got into the状态,纷纷涌入愈加拥挤的舞池之中. Our distance也因此而变得更近了.

碰撞,溅出水滴 in the瓢泼"大雨". Her帽子碰到了我的下巴. "Put your fucking hands up!" the DJ on stage said. Her高举的手 in the rhythm碰到ed my hand.

She turned around, tucked the drink under her arm,双手合十半蹲了一下, saying sorry to me. The羞涩的笑意 in her eyes was as明媚柔和 as黄昏.

She handed over the bucket of酒并将吸管朝向我. It tasted like rum with Coke. And I returned a hug—I had wanted to do that all along.

And thus experienced that强烈的冲击.

---

This冲击如同长枪一般扎入我的胸口. The构成理性的符号力场 was戳破了. Below,汹涌的爱欲 erupted火山爆发般,试图接住这个以雷霆万钧之力戳入我的精神领域的外来者.炙热的波涛努力地变换着形态,企图修补已经不完整的力场,尝试捕捉哪怕一点点的理性和意义,尝试为她建立一个可被理解的形象. This不自觉却又过载运行的努力没有成功. I felt好累.

It穿过ed all表象, entered the虚无 of the本体, forming a奇点. There, it开启ed its永恒的圆周运动, and would be赋予时间性 in the光阴 to come.

Aye! **Supersensible is appearance qua appearance**

## The Journey's End Arrived at 1/3 of the Itinerary

In that night's dream, I walked toward her as she rested nearby, asked for her contact. She gave me a自信而明媚的笑容.
Then everything褪去了. Waking up, I remembered I had decided not to do that,刻意地没有问除了名字之外的任何信息, letting the狂欢 in the dance floor end and us相忘于江湖.

That was最妙. After tonight, there was no possibility of us meeting again. And my journey would be彻底圆满 because of such遗憾.

In the days after, I would still懊恼自己为何这般固执,下了那样奇怪的决心. I couldn't help but好奇 if I hadn't忍住ed and asked for her contact, what story would have unfolded?

But this was最妙. I had to let that day's self陷入深深的迷惘 in such a沉醉的状态. Only then would this encounter become深刻; only then would I痛切地反思, wanting to告别自己过去一年的浑噩; only then could I create出一个奇异的量子场域, letting想象力不受控制地迸发,去创造一千万个精彩纷呈的宇宙. Yes, I would好奇 if I hadn't忍住ed and asked for her contact, what story would have unfolded? That would be一千万个不同的故事,或苦涩、或甜蜜、或平淡无奇、或精彩纷呈. Regardless, I渴望接下来的生活中所有的可能性. I must use this渴望的脉冲 to make my already开始疲惫的心再次强有力地跳动起来. I would gain一千万个新的梦. Then, I would witness them坍缩成一个我尚不知晓,却无比期待的现实.

The journey's end had already抵达ed. It was located at 1/3 of the行程. The following days would be用于咀嚼与休息. The重新跳动起来的心脏 needed time to send fresh blood to every cell in the body.

The final hour was spent swaying together. In this清凉的酷暑, Mint stood right in front of me,背靠着我. I placed my head on Mint's shoulder—and she抓ed my hand, placing it on her waist. When a new round of暴雨泼下来, for a moment I held tighter, and Mint also leaned her head against my chin. The water of Songkran washed away everything.我只闻到一点微弱的、生机勃勃的汗味.
