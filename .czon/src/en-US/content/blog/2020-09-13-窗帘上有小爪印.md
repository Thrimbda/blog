"title": "Little Paw Prints on the Curtain and Reflections on Time"
"summary": "Using cat paw prints on a curtain as a starting point, this article delves into reflections on the perceived speed of time's passage, the formation of personal style, and the construction of taste. The author recounts the experience of reading Frank Lloyd Wright's autobiography to illustrate that style requires a solid foundation and the catalysis of time, while taste needs to be cultivated through training and life experience. The article also cites examples like Keats' poetry and the play *Copenhagen* to show how great works can transcend time and space to touch people's hearts. Ultimately, the author connects these reflections with personal life experiences, expressing a longing for a rich and fulfilling life."

A while ago, I returned to Suzhou. Putao didn't come back with me. As I was turning off the lights to sleep, I noticed several deep little paw prints on the curtain. I finally couldn't hold back and got out of bed in the middle of the night, pondering the over half a month Putao spent alone at home—time, and the things that have flowed along with time, influencing my life.

In a previous article, we discussed the shape of time, its power, its playfulness and mockery. One point particularly worth emphasizing is that the speed at which time passes feels different depending on a person's state. The Boss and I have observed that recently it seems to be accelerating exponentially: it feels as if half of this year passed in an instant. Yet, upon careful thought, it seems last year was the same. I always feel like not much time has passed since I last wrote that article, but it has already been over a year.

Although this year passed quickly, it was also rich. Beyond richness, it carried more of the breath of life and the witnessing of life.

And indeed, all of this began over a year ago, in the days before time started accelerating, with a book, an architect who wrote himself into its pages.

***

On February 11th of that year, daidai sent me a picture—the cover of a book that read: `An Autobiography: Frank Lloyd Wright`.

"You'll like it."

And so, this architect who hated sentimentality yet was exquisitely rich came to live in my mind.

By revisiting his life, he taught me two important things for witnessing this world:

The first is **style**. The formation of style requires time as a catalyst. First, we need to solidly master the basics, reaching a state where we can act freely without overstepping boundaries. Using riding a bicycle as an analogy: in the end, you don't need your hands to steer, but your body, or your heart. If you think about riding over the solid line on the bike lane, you won't deviate. After the foundation is laid, it's a specific creative process: facing a problem domain, raising the questions that trouble us on the critical path, and then using the foundation we've built to solve problems or express emotions.

**At the moment we put the final period, style quietly arrives. What's left to do is to welcome and appreciate it. This is a joyful moment.**

What is style? It's like tangible colors in the objective world. Take Van Gogh's paintings: he would exaggeratedly express certain phenomena existing in the world, not sparing his paint, and in some parts, one could say quite rough, forming a strong distinctiveness. This distinctiveness can be said to be the embodiment of style. However, everyone appreciates this beauty, his paintings, in different ways, or may not even find them beautiful. Is the understanding of style a completely subjective feeling?

What is good style? This leads to the second important thing the architect discussed: **taste**. Who possesses such good taste that they can appreciate a specific work of art and savor the style that practically leaps out from it?

Like the cypress trees and starry night in Van Gogh's brushstrokes; the haunting song of the nightingale in Keats' poetry; Beethoven's picturesque, vibrant Sixth Symphony; these universally acclaimed excellent works are each unique, yet all possess a solid, graceful power that can transcend time and space, cross the barriers of the human heart, make people firm, give them meaning, and lend coherence to life.

However, appreciating these works undoubtedly requires a certain degree of training. Take "Ode on Melancholy" as an example: `Aye, in the very temple of delight, Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine`. When I first read it, I was just at the age of having an adult mind but little worldly experience. I only felt the meaning of this line was obscure. As I learned about Keats' life and began to pay homage to the shrine of melancholy in my own life, it started to grow in my heart in a unique way.

Or take drama as an example: `"Why did Heisenberg return to Copenhagen in 1941?"` Why did that brief meeting at Bohr's home in Copenhagen end Heisenberg and Bohr's twenty-year friendship? This question, which has haunted the public for over half a century, serves as the clue in the play *Copenhagen*, forming the background and foundational framework of the entire drama. In reality, it cleverly illustrates just how complex the human heart can be. Behind a single decision and action collapsed into reality, there may lie a dozen or dozens of motives in a state of superposition.

Heisenberg was an old friend of the Bohr family and also a German sharing war guilt; he was like Bohr's most outstanding son, while also bearing the roles of husband and father himself. And his motives were even more numerous than his identities: Was it because Heisenberg wanted to prevent the birth of nuclear weapons? Because he wanted to shoulder the burden of reviving the entire German scientific community? Because he had become Germany's youngest professor? Or simply because Heisenberg was like a homesick child? Or perhaps Heisenberg himself didn't even know why he came? And this state of confusion and chaos expanded exponentially like a chain reaction, ultimately saving all the cities not bombed with nuclear weapons by Axis Germany. Humanity! A collection of contradictions!

In the summer of 2018, Xiao Shi took me to see this play at Peking University. Since then, it has lingered in my mind, growing richer with each revisit. This is perhaps the process of building taste: first entering my memory, and as life goes on, scenes from the play are enacted in reality in various different yet connected ways, allowing me to appreciate it further. Simultaneously, it guides my real life, granting equal respect to the dozen or so motives behind others' decisions.

So what is taste?

You could say taste is entirely doctrinal, a logically self-consistent virtual system, thus building bridges between people's hearts, with the destinations of these bridges completely unrestricted. You could also say taste should be objective, transcending human likes and dislikes, merely a reflection of the real world in the human heart.

The architect didn't provide an answer; he simply assumed taste exists. Doctrinal or an objective existence—they are actually contradictory yet unified. It must reflect some attribute of reality, hardly contradicting it, yet also not stopping at reality and mechanical materialism. It provides guidance for human reason and aesthetics, constructing civilization upon the foundation of the real environment. These rich works provide me with raw materials. Like poetry, perhaps not understood at first meeting, but often recalled, often resonating, they constitute my taste.

Style and taste, like `apply` and `eval`, follow the way of nature, constructing the architect's rugged yet abundant life.

*Every time I open that autobiography, no matter my mood, I ultimately return to a harmonious tranquility. How should a person spend their life? I hope to be as abundant as the architect.*

When I read about Frank's final decision to join Sullivan's firm, saying goodbye to his former boss, he had this description in his autobiography:

![Pain](https://0xc1.space/images/2020/09/13/pain.jpg)

This scene stayed in my memory for a long time, until I had a similar experience and realized all the preparation was useless; the pain came unexpectedly. Just like the little paw prints on the curtain, in the days and nights I was away, Putao walked onto the bay window countless times, scratching the curtain with her little paws, earnestly hoping that the moment she scratched, I would appear behind the curtain to playfully respond. She scratched and scratched, her claws, sharp from not being trimmed for too long, caught the curtain, pulling out those little paw prints.
