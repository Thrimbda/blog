> Keats once saw a young lady for a few minutes and was so captivated and even heartbroken by her.

## To -

```
TIME’S sea hath been five years at its slow ebb,
  Long hours have to and fro let creep the sand,
Since I was tangled in thy beauty’s web,
  And snared by the ungloving of thine hand.

And yet I never look on midnight sky,
  But I behold thine eyes’ well memoried light;
I cannot look upon the rose’s dye,
  But to thy cheek my soul doth take its flight.

I cannot look on any budding flower,
  But my fond ear, in fancy at thy lips
And harkening for a love-sound, doth devour
  Its sweets in the wrong sense:—Thou dost eclipse

Every delight with sweet remembering,
And grief unto my darling joys dost bring.
```

### Note

Later, it was discovered that the final two lines of this poem, `To - ["Time's sea"]`:

```
Every delight with sweet remembering,
And grief unto my darling joys dost bring.
```

share a rhythmic similarity with these lines from Shakespeare's `sonnet CXIII`:

```
Even so, being full of your ne'er cloying sweetness,
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding.
```

No wonder a footnote to Keats' poem once mentioned, "In the rhythmic handling of emotional structure and in the gradually intensifying musicality, it closely resembles Shakespeare's sonnets."
