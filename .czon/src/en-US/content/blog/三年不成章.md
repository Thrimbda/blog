> Since yesterday's snowfall, all of Xi'an has become twice as cold.
> ~~Twice as cold means you need to wear clothes twice as thick as before~~

Borrowed an image to set the tone for this piece.
Why did I choose such a title? Because on my way back to the lab from Kangqiao after dinner today, the scene stirred my emotions, and I felt the urge to express my thoughts.

## The Biggest Snow Since University (Or Is It?)

> Actually, the snow on January 31st this year was heavier.

I stayed overnight in the lab the night before last. Since the room is fully equipped with heating and air conditioning, and we almost never open the windows, it was very warm. It was only when I went out to use the restroom that I felt it was a bit colder than usual. It was dark, and I didn't think much of it.

—It wasn't until I was half-awoken by the cold the next morning that I slowly realized it had snowed.
It snowed all day, only stopping after 11 PM.

Unfortunately, I stayed in the lab that night to meet a noon deadline today, so I spent the entire snowy day indoors. It wasn't until I finished my work in the evening that I decided to go back to the dorm to rest for the night. The uncles and aunties selling late-night snacks deserve praise for their dedication, setting up their stalls on such a cold night. So, I went to support their business.

Thus, I ~~*wasted*~~ missed the beautiful snowy scenery.

## More Interesting Than the Snow Are the Southern Kids Going "Wow"

> The above line is a playful jab.

I am very fond of expressing my reflections, often getting emotionally stirred by scenes and sighing with感慨.

Last year, a classmate invited me to the Big Wild Goose Pagoda. After the music fountain show ended, the bustling square quickly emptied. Gazing at the ancient pagoda, I was moved:
It has stood here quietly for a thousand years; in comparison, a human life is truly too short. ~~And as lonely as snow.~~
For a moment, a profound sense of history washed over me. I stood there, stunned, savoring the flood of emotions.

We are moved by scenes probably because something touches our hearts. When Marco Polo described the city of Phyllida to Kublai Khan, he said:

> If you feel one of the two arcades is more pleasant, it is because thirty years ago a girl in an embroidered skirt with wide sleeves passed there, or because the light at a certain hour reminds you of an arcade somewhere else.

## Like a Spectator, Watching Someone Else's Life

> I felt very sad after returning that day. Why?

I love talking big, discussing life and ideals—it feels great!
Sitting comfortably in a coffee shop, holding forth eloquently and lamenting the past and present is, of course, carefree and enjoyable. But if, afterwards, one does not **internalize it in the heart and express it through action**, like the musician Shi Wen learning the qin, then it's just idleness.
I also want to echo Zhu Ziqing and say: This year I am twenty, I am really too clever.

**What is there to express without any沉淀 (accumulation/reflection)?**
In high school, I enjoyed criticizing the country and the education system, calling them factories mass-producing fools.
But upon second thought, being such a cynical youth, such talk wouldn't change the country or education one bit. The only thing it achieves is venting dissatisfaction, then continuing to struggle in the sea of suffering, making no progress, and becoming one of the aforementioned fools.

After describing all the cities he had visited, Polo summarized to the Great Khan:

> The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together.
> There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: **seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.**

Actually, both passages above were said by Italo Calvino through Polo's mouth.

## The Greatness of a University Lies in Its Culture

> This is a quote my high school chemistry teacher attributed to Lu Xun.

**John Henry Newman, Bishop of Oxford and initiator of the Oxford Movement, stated in his famous discourse "The Idea of a University":**

> Gentlemen, if I had to choose between a so-called university which dispensed with residence and tutorial superintendence, and gave its degrees to any person who passed an examination in a wide range of subjects, and a university which had no professors or examinations at all, but merely brought a number of young men together for three or four years... I have no hesitation in giving the preference to that university which did nothing... Why? ... I am prepared to maintain that... when a multitude of young persons, keen, open-hearted, sympathetic, and observant, as young persons are, come together and freely mix with each other, they are sure to learn one from another, even if there be no one to teach them; the conversation of all is a series of lectures to each, and they gain for themselves new ideas and views, fresh matter of thought, and distinct principles for judging and acting...

_Although Xi'an Jiaotong University follows the former system, it more or less shines with the brilliance of the latter._

After dinner, I walked out of Kangqiao, breathing out puffs of air. Although the day was cold, it was mealtime, and the area outside the cafeteria was very lively, with soft music playing from the broadcast.
As I passed through the crowd, I often overheard people's conversations. Some were discussing their latest research directions, others debating a question about mechanics, and still others talking about the design of something... I felt somewhat moved and finally realized that most of the people before me were future artists, scientists, and engineers.

Although it was after a heavy snow, a season when all things wither, I witnessed an unprecedented vitality.

**How fortunate! Let me sing to express my aspiration.**

## Postscript

Having survived the deadline, I breathed a long sigh of relief and wrote this piece.
