Just a few farewell dinners, a few items to pick up, and in a few days, I will truly graduate, leaving the sweet dreamland to once again set foot on the soil of reality.

Just now, I was chatting with the class monitor. We both knew in our hearts that this was probably the last chat before graduation. We talked about nothing but the future, ending with a phrase like a secret code. I sent it out, and he sent it back: **Be a light to the world**.

It comes from the school song of Xi'an Jiaotong University.

> How splendid is our school, the flower of truth, a model for youth, the glory of the nation,
>
> The school flag flutters, growing with the sun, be a light to the world, be a light to the world.
>
> How splendid is our school, inspiring the masses, enlightening our wisdom, igniting our passion,
>
> Talented individuals gather, venturing far and wide, be a light to the world, be a light to the world.
>
>
>
> How splendid is our school, the source of spirit, the abode of science, the garden of art,
>
> Industry expands, progress knows no bounds, be a light to the world, be a light to the world.
>
> How splendid is our school, brilliant civilization, practical learning strengthens the nation, the nation achieves revival,
>
> Vast is the universe, high are the mountains, long are the rivers, be a light to the world, be a light to the world.

Graduation is imminent. Many things and many people cannot be dealt with or bid farewell to in time. I am about to be swept away by the torrent of the times, either dashed against the broader shores of fate or riding the waves, forging ahead, becoming a navigator of the era. Not to mention the overused but beautiful phrase: "Our journey is to the stars and the sea." Ambition and lofty aspirations are always there, especially at this moment—the moment of parting, the moment of ending, the season of new beginnings. This feeling, I think, can only be expressed by the phrase "be a light to the world" from the school song of my alma mater, which I both love and hate and am about to leave.

> Heaven and earth interact, and all things connect; superiors and inferiors interact, and their aspirations align.

~~I have finally graduated and can openly use the term "alma mater."~~

### Coming to Jiao Da After Failing Exams?

I don't know from which senior I heard it: "People at Xi'an Jiaotong University have a sense of resentment, even to the point of 'coming to Jiao Da after failing exams.'" This impression was very profound for me when I first entered the university campus four years ago: even before the semester started, I glimpsed the depression of failing the Peking University entrance exam from a new classmate's QQ space, with the original words being "**living towards death**." This sentiment was particularly evident in student unions and clubs—everyone was unhappy, feeling they had been wronged by coming here. My future "roommate" also confided in me during a late-night talk that he felt like a stray dog, his plans disrupted, dreams shattered, and a disgrace to his teachers!

Narrowing it down to my major: the air was even more filled with a sense of despair. Due to low admission scores, this major became a good place for transferring students, and all freshmen had the opportunity to transfer into it without cost when registering at the school to attract students. **It seemed very cheap, a major despised by everyone, so how could those who came not despise themselves?** During military training, leaders from the neighboring School of Electronic and Information Engineering came to greet us. Out of 3,500 freshmen on the track field, 800 stood up, crowding a corner of the field, creating a spectacular scene. The School of Software, however, had only one department, the Software Engineering major. When leaders came, only about 80 people gathered, sparse and desolate. But I was naive and didn't think about these things at the time; instead, I took the opportunity to observe the girls I had never seen before.

The above mindset is a commonality among students at Jiao Da and in the Software Engineering major. I might be an exception because my classmates and I all got into university based on our abilities. Why could they "fail exams with ability," while I couldn't "exceed expectations with ability" and joyfully come to the university campus without feeling like an unworthy addition? But I could still feel my classmates' disappointment, and I was clearly affected. Fortunately, this mindset lasted at most a year for most people. Once we became familiar with our new base, built new friendships, and even licked our wounds to reclaim new dreams, the past disappointments and regrets became insignificant. We began to vaguely realize the **new mission and vision** we possessed, just as the school song says, we should "be a light to the world."

### The Cradle of Engineers

During my freshman year, the teacher teaching computer basics joked that our school was the "cradle of engineers," meaning it only produces engineers but not leaders, becoming the backbone of society but mostly buried in the torrent, serving as a solid foundation for the superstructure. He commented on the school motto: "**Diligence in Study, Sincerity in Ambition, Perseverance in Action, and Responsibility in Duty**." It seemed to me he had grievances he couldn't fully express, both admirable and frustrating. I couldn't say I disagreed, but I also lamented that the school didn't teach students to have lofty ambitions.

This actually fits my own characteristics: **unsuited to being a leader, yet unwilling to be a follower, but worthy of being an observer**. I'm not foolish, but each of the four points in the school motto is something I lack and need to learn. As for the rest, principles and applications need to be savored in the details of life, not hindering progress. Additionally, I have a strange ability—to inadvertently say what I most want to say and do what I truly want to do. Sometimes, this stumbling can lead to painful collisions, but after pruning the dead branches and leaves, one truly becomes more spirited.

Thus, under the influence of the resentment described earlier and through my own unintentional yet sincere choices, I moved forward with unsteady steps. The various events in life, when strung together, make the coincidences and close calls seem incredible in hindsight. If I were to attend university a second time, it would be entirely different. These events include suddenly deciding to abandon the student union at 4 a.m. the night before the election for department head, feeling that I should devote myself to the Microsoft Student Club family I loved, where I stayed for four years; later, after eating lunch at Wutong Yuan, seeing the long-awaited robotics team setting up a booth and happily signing up, spending a whole year with the rule "sign in at the team except during class time, Friday afternoons, and a ten-day holiday during the New Year," which boosted my overall technical sensibility and confidence; signing up for the Microsoft Student Summer Camp during the summer of my sophomore year on a whim and meeting a respectable friend, who also helped arrange my current plans with little effort just before graduation; interning at a lab, gaining a unique early experience of graduate student life at our school and firmly deciding not to pursue postgraduate studies; during the lab internship, taking on an outsourcing project that left me so discouraged afterward. Please note that the times mentioned in the following are all in the past perfect tense:

> Last September, because I was short on money, I took on a private job to build a website, scheduled to go live at the end of October. Little did I know it would become a veritable `tar pit` that I couldn't complete in a semester. Thus, there is this **mythical man-month**, serving as a lesson for my failure to humbly learn from the earnest teachings and valuable experiences of predecessors, my arrogance, and my狼狈不堪, writing ugly code before looking back and understanding the principles. I also hope to use this as a summary of my personal learning life, trying to extract some insights and ultimately elevate my own境界 a little.

And finally, the half-year of hurriedly learning from scratch, which I had planned but not anticipated, only to make a sharp turn at the critical moment to go abroad for further study [matter](http://0xc1.space/2017/12/10/%E8%A1%8C%E7%99%BE%E9%87%8C%E8%80%85%E5%8D%8A%E4%B9%9D%E5%8D%81/). I ended up sitting on my bed, writing this essay with great interest.

**The eagerness of the first year, the艰苦积累 of the second year, the happiness and helplessness of the third year, and the迷茫与淡然 of the fourth year are the blood and fire in this cradle.**

Therefore, I am not discouraged by being trained as an engineer. Doesn't Google in the West also advocate "ask the engineer"? During the母校's 120th anniversary the year before last, I asked myself, "Can I be a light to the world?" A candid friend said, "Just a code farmer."

I only hope to be the kind of code farmer who cannot be easily replaced, **孕育出不朽的逻辑果实 from the fields of thought**.

### Remembering the Source When Drinking Water

An anecdote once occurred on campus: two men fought in a classroom, prompting a boy in red in the class to stand up and say, "This is Xi'an Jiaotong University, a world-class institution, and yet you are here acting wildly. Do you think this is appropriate?!" It caused a sensation across the campus at the time, and a wave of思潮随之而起...

I also think of an article that flooded my朋友圈 during the school anniversary: "Jiaotong University ≠ Shanghai Jiaotong University." There seem to be five Jiaotong Universities nationwide with the same roots: Shanghai Jiaotong University, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Southwest Jiaotong University, Beijing (Northern) Jiaotong University, and National Chiao Tung University. Among them, Shanghai Jiaotong University and Xi'an Jiaotong University are most closely related, originating from the Nanyang Public School founded by the Beiyang Government in 1896. The Nanyang Public School was renamed several times, becoming Jiaotong University, then National Chiao Tung University. Finally, on the 60th anniversary of its founding, the main part of the university moved west to the vast northwest to support development and construction, growing into Xi'an Jiaotong University. The part that remained in Shanghai became independent after three years and is now Shanghai Jiaotong University. Due to various factors, Shanghai Jiaotong University has brought great honor and is the leader among the five兄弟, so the resounding name "Jiaotong University" has silently become equated with Shanghai Jiaotong University in the minds of scholars and the public at home and abroad. Students of XJTU, fueled by the "coming to Jiao Da after failing exams" mentality, began to speak up for their beloved alma mater, even resenting that Chairman Jiang later only visited SJTU and not XJTU. I share this sentiment too. A few days ago, a senior from another school saw my photo with Chairman Jiang and exclaimed, "Chairman Jiang is also from Jiao Da?" thinking he had misspoken and corrected himself: "XJTU, not Jiao Da." I stuck out my tongue at the screen.

Interestingly, all five Jiaotong Universities have an almost identical "Remembering the Source When Drinking Water" monument, with a three-dimensional school emblem on top and the words "Remembering the Source When Drinking Water" engraved on it. Once we truly enter the现实修罗场, as long as we hear that someone is a classmate or senior from Jiao Da, we feel a special亲切. Some even go so far as to truly implement the idea that it is Jiaotong University without distinguishing between XJTU and SJTU, so they纷纷去了上交读研. **After the jokes, heroes are不问出处, everyone works based on their abilities, and loving one's school is another matter of emotion. We just need to remember to remember the source when drinking water.**

## Beautiful Dream, Reality

> Giving this title might make it seem like I am沉迷于空想而罔顾现实, but in reality, it is both true and not.

As mentioned at the beginning of this article, "**leaving the sweet dreamland to once again set foot on the soil of [reality](http://0xc1.space/2018/03/08/'Tis-not-through-envy-of-thy-happy-lot/).**" Since going to Beijing for an internship in mid-January this year, I have realized the preciousness of school life. I once inwardly shouted, "Why don't I go back to school to be a咸鱼 before graduation?!" **In reality, internship life is very新奇有趣,充满干劲, and there are opportunities to suddenly realize it's already 11 p.m.** What I want to say is that campus life is like a beautiful dream. Every time I return to school, I续上了这酣甜的梦乡.

So, in early March, I played games until 4 a.m., in early April, slept until noon, ordered a box of roast duck rice, spent the afternoon混迹 in the学院, went to康桥 for dinner, took a shower at the温泉浴室, and bought lemon black tea at the小黑店. In early May, in addition to that, I went to the东南门 at night to buy卷馍,豆腐凉菜, and面筋—we called it "味觉巅峰 top of the taste"—to spend my "typical day" on campus. Even sweating on a staircase on campus felt incredibly幸福, like returning home after世外斧柯烂 to find everything unchanged.

However, on the high-speed train back to school for答辩 in June, my heart was as calm as still water. It was as if I had slept a long, beautiful sleep, with sunlight shining on the quilt, the浓睡还未散尽, my body and mind rested,浮上水面 from the depths of sleep, opening my eyes,安详而满足. Though beautiful, the dream was终究是深睡眠的梦, in the dream, there were only eyes and ears, to learn and listen. Now awake, I have the strength to施展.乾,元亨利贞,一爻变二爻三爻,潜龙出水, it is time to寻见大人而后终日乾乾,朝夕警惕了.

The novelty of the first two years of university wasn't enough, and the last two years passed飞快 like riding a rocket. Many of these stories I told to my diary, and more I didn't tell it because I was犯懒. But the原始未受扰动的 environment gave me many opportunities to make良性错误 that wouldn't knock me out of the game and to learn knowledge to avoid mistakes, identifying恶性错误 that, once made, would knock me out with no chance of弥补. The process of making mistakes and the taste of the恶果 were the most unpleasant, allowing me to加深印象,舔舐伤口, and learn from them. In the play "Copenhagen," Heisenberg says, "Left, right, or think about it and die." I deeply agreed and posted it on my朋友圈 to警示自己, but after细细回想品味, I found that the context this sentence applies to is skiing. In such紧张刺激的运动, one can only turn left or right based on肌肉记忆 formed from previous falls. If one thinks at this moment, they will miss the时机,一命呜呼, and be判出局 by fate. The key is to**不断思考、不断摔跤、不断形成新的肌肉记忆** in缓和的环境, so that in truly险恶的环境, one can敏捷机智地转左、转右, and enjoy the刺激与快乐 brought by极限运动 in the process.

I预感 that the life ahead will still be filled with opportunities to make良性错误 and moments of not making any mistakes. The process will not be轻松愉快, but it will绝对引人入胜.
