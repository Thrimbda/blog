What does travel mean to me?

For some, travel means conquest. Knowing in advance where to go, what to do, and then checking off destinations and achievements.

For me, travel means searching. There is no physical endpoint; the incompleteness that arises from leaving home becomes the driving force to move forward. Carrying this sense of lack, I search for what my heart is missing. I don’t know what it is, but whatever it is will mark the end of this journey. Endings are rare, so my travels are often accompanied by anxiety—a longing for the endpoint and the accompanying fear of never reaching it.

A record of a long-awaited journey.

## Departure - A Bumpy Start

The car’s battery showed 0%, with 0 kilometers remaining. At this point, the three of us were 4 kilometers from Pudong Airport, with 9 minutes left before check-in closed. To make matters worse, Ji Ge suddenly realized he had brought his old passport by mistake…

In the end, only A Zheng and I boarded the flight to Chiang Mai. Even after boarding, we were still shaken. I’ve never believed in bad luck, but today was indeed not smooth sailing.

We were still working before departure, and we paid a high price for a critical mistake—this was the start of the trouble. After a quick review, we had miscalculated the time it would take to get from home to Pudong Airport. We set off leisurely—driving, then having a designated driver take the car home.

When we started the navigation, we realized it would take an hour and a half longer than expected. If the estimated time was accurate, we would miss check-in. Relying on Nomi’s autopilot for a leisurely drive was impossible. The only way out was to drive carefully but boldly, speeding as much as possible while ensuring safety, despite traffic jams, rain, and low battery, to gain about five minutes.

After over an hour of frantic driving, we did gain some time, arriving at the scene described at the beginning.

After boarding, I felt exhausted, as if I had lost my sharp sensitivity to life. In the past few hours, I had experienced the frustration of a work mistake, the tension of rushing to catch a flight, and the regret of a companion not making it. Yet, I felt no anticipation for the upcoming trip. Thinking about it, this kind of travel excitement had been absent from my life for a long time.

I turned on airplane mode and drifted into a drowsy sleep. When I picked up my phone again, an hour had passed. Only then did I see a message from Playground an hour earlier, saying that an important matter had finally been resolved. A warm feeling, like black tea, slowly flowed into my heart. Empathy kicked in, and I finally relaxed, letting out a long sigh.

What would happen in the coming days? We planned to stay in Chiang Mai for two days and Bangkok for four, but aside from the two nights in Chiang Mai, we hadn’t booked hotels or flights. Amid this chaos, I began to feel a glimmer of anticipation for the trip.

## Songkran

Our trip coincided with Songkran, the grandest festival of the Dai-Thai ethnic groups across Southeast Asia. It carries a beautiful meaning: washing away the dust of the past year and starting anew.

After resting and preparing for a night, we met up with Ji Ge’s friends (though he couldn’t make it due to the mishap). It was the first day of Songkran. Ji Ge’s friends had rented a pickup truck, equipped with two large buckets of water, three water guns for long-range attacks, and four or five small buckets for close combat.

Near the moat of the old city, we arrived at a corner of the main battlefield—a scene of chaos I had never seen before: people were in disarray, everyone using every suitable container to splash water on others. The abundant supply of ice turned the harmless warm water into refreshingly cold water. People joyfully shouted and splashed each other.

![image0](https://0xc1.space/images/2024/04/19/fighting_people.jpg)

Boys and girls on the streets indiscriminately drenched every passing object with water guns, buckets, and other “weapons.” Street vendors sold food, ice, and water for refills (mostly scooped from the river), and they themselves joined in the splashing. No one could resist the revelry of Songkran. Passersby on bikes could only be splashed, at best firing back with their small water guns during brief lulls in the onslaught.

The main force was countless pickup trucks like ours, slowly advancing through severely congested roads. On the trucks, regardless of age or gender, people either sprayed water at everyone with all their might or were joyfully drenched with ice water, only to recover and retaliate seconds later. Some trucks had built-in speakers, so the people on them swayed passionately to the rhythm, indifferent to the water being splashed on them. Nearly ten people swaying in unison made the truck seem like it was dancing, rocking up and down.

Everyone was laughing and shouting—a true carnival for all.

Unfortunately, we had to stop midway. On one hand, the scorching sun quickly gave us sunburns. On the other, after I went to bed early the previous night, A Zheng and the others bought afternoon tickets to Bangkok—perhaps thinking Chiang Mai was just a simple appetizer, while Bangkok had more captivating attractions. I had no strong opinion, feeling that Songkran was already fun enough.

As it turned out, we were all somewhat mistaken.

After a two-kilometer trek under the blazing sun, we finally left the heavily congested area and took a taxi back to the homestay.

After a hot shower and changing into dry clothes, while packing to leave for Bangkok, A Zheng realized his phone was missing.

## The Urban Chase

I called A Zheng’s phone several times before confirming it wasn’t in the room.

Anxiety surged. Losing a phone in a foreign country with a language barrier is no easy task to resolve. To make matters worse, we were about to leave for the airport, and time was very, very tight.

At first, we thought it might have been left in the ride-hailing car, so we called customer service. However, the service couldn’t contact the driver who had taken us back, forcing us to find another solution.

Time ticked away, and we still had no clue how to find the phone. Should we call the police? Would that even help?

Got it! Let’s try the iPhone’s Find My feature. About every two minutes, A Zheng could see his phone’s location updated on the Find My app on his Mac. The latest location was just north of Chiang Mai’s old city. We decided to take a taxi and head to his phone’s location to try our luck. A strange mirror image emerged: I used my phone as a hotspot, while he held his laptop. We ventured out in clothes not suited for getting wet.

Midway, the driver dropped us off, unwilling to enter the severe congestion. One of us holding a phone, the other a laptop, we ran like madmen toward the constantly changing location.

We were definitely going to miss the flight, but fortunately, the homestay was booked for two days, so we could stay another night.

Midway, I received a call—from A Zheng’s number. But after answering, all I could hear was street noise, as if it was an accidental touch. This suggested the person who found the phone wasn’t a thief, as a thief would have turned it off and wouldn’t make such a mistake.

We were getting closer. A Zheng’s phone wasn’t moving as if in a vehicle, so we could keep up by running. The phone left the main road and entered a small alley.

Finally, we intercepted the scavenger who had found the phone in front of a mobile phone shop in the alley. The phone case was already gone. I guess we’ll never know whether the old man intended to sell the phone or hand it over to the more knowledgeable phone shop to fulfill the act of returning lost property. Regardless, A Zheng expressed his gratitude and gave the old man some money as a reward.

The feeling of recovering something lost is incredible! Once again, I felt the vividness of life in an adventure given by fate. A Zheng was also incredibly excited—I’d never seen someone so happy about missing a flight.

## Zoe in Yellow

The moment we found the phone, to celebrate, A Zheng suggested we grab a drink. So, I looked up bars in the city and found one that seemed decent, called Zoe in Yellow. I immediately imagined what kind of place it might be.

In that moment, the future revealed its hazy veil to me.

However, the direction into the city was filled with crazy water-splashing revelers, eager to evenly drench everyone in sight. Pleading with gestures was useless. Looking at my freshly changed clothes and shoes, I quickly extinguished that momentary anticipation and returned to rationality, deciding not to go.

Back at the homestay, after resting and rebooking a flight to Bangkok for early the next morning (but without eating), my companions decided to head into the city for some fun. I, however, was too hungry to muster any enthusiasm and prepared to head back.

After parting ways with my companions, I tiredly hailed a Grab motorbike to return to the Maya Plaza near the homestay for some food, then head back to sleep early.

According to my original plan, I shouldn’t have taken a motorbike. The whistling evening wind, combined with the water splashed by pedestrians, washed away my fatigue.

My clothes were soaked in the漫天 water spray. Amid the roaring engine of the motorbike, I collided with the warm wind. On this early summer night, I shook my hair, leaving a few droplets in the wind, and the wind returned a touch of coolness as thanks.

Perhaps because Songkran is like a contagious carnival virus, before getting splashed, I was a civilized, dignified person, caring about my neat, dry clothes. But after getting soaked, I only wanted to join the reveling crowd and make the next civilized person who cared about their appearance join my ranks. It wasn’t even 9 p.m.—the timing was perfect. I had just entered the city—the location was perfect. I immediately decided to change course and head to Zoe.

Like a shy introvert dragged to a party by a confident extrovert, people tried to talk to the introvert, but he could only smile awkwardly. Meanwhile, his extroverted friend loudly introduced his shy friend to the crowd. Except both were me—a somewhat schizophrenic, awkward me, wanting to revel but holding back.

Standing at the entrance of Zoe, I heard deafening music inside. Surrounding the dance floor were stalls selling snacks and bars. I decided to fill my stomach first, maybe have a drink or two.

People were so joyful. After a gin and tonic, I was drenched again by a nearby foreigner with a water gun. Damn it! I’ve had enough of being human, of being a normal, polite human, of rationality. To hell with it—today is for revelry.

I entered the dance floor, cautiously at first, maneuvering around, but inevitably getting sprayed from all sides.
Once on the dance floor, the sprinklers above worked like heavy rain, evenly drenching everyone.

But how do you dance? This was my first time actually going to a club. Just sway to the rhythm! Everyone was dancing their own way, and I wasn’t performing on stage, so there was nothing to be shy about, I comforted myself.

In front of me, slightly to the side, was a white couple. They embraced and swayed to the rhythm, as if the entire dance floor, or the whole world, consisted only of the two of them, swaying in perfect harmony. I felt a stir in my heart. Was I longing for such interaction?

Closing my eyes, I danced clumsily to the rhythm, still awkward, still shy.

![image1](https://0xc1.space/images/2024/04/19/dance_in_the_water.jpg)

When I opened my eyes again, this girl with blue braids and a black baseball cap appeared beside me.

—“She dances so freely.”
The first thought said. She faced away from the DJ booth, opposite everyone else, dancing freely, elegantly and powerfully. It was a force of freedom, as if the world consisted only of the music’s rhythm and her dancing body. Then, I caught a glimpse of her head raised in her dance.

—“She’s so beautiful.”
The second thought burst forth. Water droplets on her face were like dewdrops in the morning sun, crystal clear. Her slightly arched eyebrows were like willow leaves, and her wide-set eyes beneath them resembled a silver fox. Her exotic eyes seemed to possess a magical power, drawing people in involuntarily. Under the恰到好处修饰 of her nasolabial folds, her mouth appeared elegant and grand, like a meticulously crafted work of art, slightly open, exuding a calm and composed aura. In her confident smile, dimples faintly appeared, like a hidden bright star in the night sky, quietly shining.

In the声浪 exceeding 100db, the world fell silent. I became semi-transparent, as if only this girl was dancing freely under a single spotlight. She seemed to be the embodiment of music, perfectly merging with the rhythm. Her blue braids swayed gently with her dance moves, like blue waves cutting through the air. Her black baseball cap tilted slightly, adding a touch of rebelliousness and mystery.

I was deeply captivated by her dance, as if time stood still. Every shrug of her shoulders, every leap, seemed like a carefully choreographed dance, filled with奇异的美感. Her face radiated confidence and joy, that pure enjoyment and free expression, like a heavy punch to my heart.

On this喧嚣的夜晚, she became the only focus in my eyes. Her presence made everything around her fade, leaving only her dance moves and the music’s rhythm echoing in the air. I could almost feel the passion and freedom within her, that unbound,尽情释放的感觉.

I wanted to join her自由舞步, to share in this pure joy.

As the music reached its climax, her dance became more intense and wild. Her body swayed freely with the rhythm, every movement filled with power and beauty. Her eyes sparkled, as if telling her story and dreams. Her raised right hand struck the air, as if the air itself had become an instrument, its声浪 reverberating across the dance floor, striking everyone’s chest, making them forget their names, becoming nothing but dancing machines.

Then, she was pulled away by a friend, and I was dragged back into the lively dance floor.

In the center of the dance floor, the暴雨般的 sprinklers sent coolness into the crowd. I was completely soaked and completely exhilarated.

Inspired by her, I began to free myself, no longer拘泥于 my dance moves, no longer worrying about others’ gazes. I let my body sway freely to the rhythm, gradually becoming confident and powerful. I felt an unprecedented sense of freedom and joy, as if the whole world was cheering for me.

I was no longer an observer but part of the music. In the rhythm, I surged, roared, flowed freely, like a flood about to destroy everything in its path. All meaningful symbols dissolved and melted into it, joining this汹涌,壮大 it, until only the music’s rhythm and my不成章法 yet无敌的舞步 remained.

Then, she appeared beside me again, still swaying freely, unconcerned with others, but now holding a small bucket of bubbly, iced饮料.

Perhaps it was my imagination, but we became a奇妙的双星系统. No matter how people pushed into or left the dance floor, she remained swaying in front of me.

As the night deepened, people gradually got into the mood, flooding into the increasingly crowded dance floor, bringing us closer together.

Collision, water droplets溅出 in the瓢泼“大雨.” Her hat touched my chin. “Put your fucking hands up,” the DJ on stage shouted. Her raised hand, moving to the rhythm, touched mine.

She turned around, tucked the drink under her arm, put her hands together,半蹲 slightly, and said sorry, her eyes羞涩的笑意如同黄昏一样明媚柔和.

She handed me the bucket of酒,吸管朝向 me. It tasted like rum with cola. In return, I gave her a hug—something I’d wanted to do all along.

And thus, I experienced that intense冲击.

---

This冲击 pierced my chest like a spear, puncturing the symbolic force field of rationality. Beneath it,汹涌的爱欲 erupted like a volcano, trying to catch this外来者 that had雷霆万钧之力戳入 my精神领域. The炙热的波涛努力变换形态, attempting to repair the already incomplete force field, trying to capture even a shred of rationality and meaning, trying to construct a comprehensible image for her. This unconscious yet overloaded effort failed. I felt exhausted.

It穿透了 all表象, entered the虚无 of the本体, forming a奇点, where it began its永恒的圆周运动, to be赋予时间性 in the days to come.

Aye! **Supersensible is appearance qua appearance**

## The Journey’s End Arrived at the 1/3 Mark

In that night’s dream, I walked toward her as she rested nearby and asked for her contact. She gave me a confident, radiant smile.
Then everything faded. Upon waking, I remembered I had decided not to do this, deliberately not asking for any information beyond her name, letting the狂欢 of the dance floor end and us forget each other in the江湖.

This was perfect. After tonight, there was no chance of us meeting again. And my journey would be彻底圆满 because of such遗憾.

In the days that followed, I would still懊恼 at my stubbornness, at making such a strange决心. I couldn’t help but wonder what story would have unfolded if I hadn’t resisted asking for her contact.

But this was perfect. I had to let myself that day fall into deep迷惘 in such a沉醉的状态. Only then would this encounter become深刻; only then would I痛切地反思, wanting to告别 the浑噩 of the past year; only then could I create a奇异的量子场域, letting imagination迸发 uncontrollably, to create ten million精彩纷呈的宇宙. Yes, I would wonder what story would have unfolded if I hadn’t resisted asking for her contact. It would be ten million different stories—bitter, sweet,平淡无奇, or精彩纷呈. Regardless, I渴望 all possibilities in the life to come. I must use this渴望的脉冲 to make my already疲惫的心 beat strongly again. I will gain ten million new dreams, and then, I will witness them坍缩 into a reality I do not yet know but无比期待.

The journey’s end had already arrived, at the 1/3 mark of the行程. The following days would be spent咀嚼与休息. The重新跳动起来的心脏 needed time to send fresh blood to every cell in the body.

The final hour was spent swaying together. In this清凉的酷暑, Mint stood directly in front of me, her back against me. I rested my head on Mint’s shoulder—and she placed my hand on her waist. As a new暴雨泼下来, for a moment, I held her tighter, and Mint leaned her head against my chin. The water of Songkran washed everything away. All I could smell was a faint,生机勃勃的汗味.
