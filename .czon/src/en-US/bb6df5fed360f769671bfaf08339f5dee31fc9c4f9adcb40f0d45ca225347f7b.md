"summary": "This article is the author's log from the third day of their internship, sharing initial experiences with learning the Spring framework. The author compares it to previously encountered web development technologies like JSP, Django, and Flask, noting that Spring is similar to Flask in being lightweight and minimally restrictive. The article focuses on the advantages of RESTful architecture, such as decoupling frontend and backend and clear representation, and mentions Spring's use of annotations for routing. The author also reflects on the elegance of programming languages, concluding that elegance stems from careful thought rather than the language itself. Finally, the author expresses a newfound appreciation for Java and anticipation for future learning."

Well, today is the third day of the internship, and so far, it's quite different from what I had imagined.

I've previously complained about the internet and its speed here: the dorm has no internet at all, and the connection in the classroom is quite poor. This situation made me suddenly realize how addicted I am to the internet, though I personally think it's not a big issue. The internet can indeed become a "Kala" that enlightens people's minds, helping our entire species evolve into a highly developed...

Getting back on track, these past two days I've been learning the Spring framework, and it feels refreshingly new. As a newcomer, I couldn't help but exclaim that Java code could also be so elegant.

Such an exclamation reveals how inexperienced I am. On second thought, what language can't be elegant? Elegance is the crystallization of wisdom from meticulous thinking and careful design; it doesn't seem to have much to do with the medium itself.

## RESTful

Currently, using the Spring framework is mainly for building web applications. Following the official tutorial, I also reviewed the benefits of RESTful architecture, which can be summarized as follows:

+ **Decoupling frontend and backend**: Since this architecture is resource-oriented, formatted text (mostly JSON?) rather than entire HTML pages is used as the Response, allowing complete separation of frontend and backend.
+ **Clear representation**: RESTful fully utilizes the characteristics of the HTTP protocol, using URIs to request resources instead of long QueryStrings separated by `&`. This reflects the design philosophy of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), not just treating it as a low-level transport protocol while messing around at the upper layer. It strictly defines CRUD operations on resources and implements them using HTTP verbs.

I've only recently emerged from ancient web development thinking, so my understanding might not be very thorough yet. If there are any misconceptions, please don't hesitate to correct me!

## Spring as a Web Framework

It's been exactly one year from the Java Web course project in my sophomore year until now. I've already encountered several web development technologies during this time. I can still recall the excitement when I first deployed an application to a server and successfully accessed it from my phone :) Having curiosity and following it to explore unknown territories is indeed a wonderful thing.

From Java's `JSP` to Python's `Django` and then `Flask`, and finally back to Java, I met `Spring`.

JSP is a truly ancient technology; using it is so cumbersome, especially during later development stages when modifying things for certain features. The entire Servlet can become a huge, lengthy monster. And when JavaBeans involve database connections with pagination requirements, achieving elegance is almost a pipe dream. JSP pages, originally intended to demonstrate high reusability, become disfigured by various `<%if(...)%>` statements, to the point where I could write [code that made me question my own existence](czon://e6cb322b3b182b051b8952954956a7a0ddc66b439175be040b71a02a768bf512). I should probably write a separate article reflecting on these heinous crimes I committed. By the way, I don't even know how to write RESTful-style web services with JSP.

Things became much clearer with Python. Whether it's the powerful capabilities of `Django` or the simplicity and clarity of `Flask`, frameworks, in contrast to the most basic pioneering technologies, seem much more straightforward. If we categorize developers into levels—the first being technology pioneers, the last being application users (even if they are completely derivative developers)—I believe framework developers belong to the second level. They summarize the development processes of commonly used technologies, extract the most common, fundamental, and essential parts, and compile them into reusable components, thus creating excellent frameworks. Because of this, excellent frameworks are also stripped from real application projects; `Django` is like this, and so is `Spring`.

But ultimately, I think `Spring` is more similar to `Flask`. They are both very lightweight and impose almost no restrictions. Perhaps `Flask`'s developers drew some inspiration from `Spring`.

### Interesting Aspects – Regarding the Symbol `@`

During my learning, I noticed that Spring's controller routing is implemented using Java's syntax feature "annotation." I need to study this feature further. Coincidentally, `Flask` also uses a similar form, though in Python, `@` is called a decorator—a syntactic sugar for wrapping functions. After browsing some materials, it seems this feature was indeed borrowed by Python from Java but with more complex functionality.

Therefore, as someone who already admired `Flask`, seeing this point made me like `Spring` even more.

## Summary

In short, my current skill level is still far from adequate, so I haven't mentioned some of Spring's core features like IoC, DI, etc. But it made me realize why Java, a language that seems old and decrepit, remains enduringly popular, and it also significantly increased my appreciation for Java.

Looking forward to learning more; it's really exciting.

Let's end with a classic log conclusion: "Today was truly a meaningful day."
