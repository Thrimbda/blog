"title": "The Pain and Introspection Triggered by Watching 'The Witch from Mercury'"
"summary": "This article is an in-depth reflection on the anime 'The Witch from Mercury.' Starting from Suletta's emotional journey, the author details the intense pain felt after watching Season 2, Episode 5, and connects it to their own entrepreneurial experiences and life insights. The essay explores Suletta's existential crisis as she transitions from 'being-in-itself' to 'being-for-itself,' and the sweetness and pain she experiences in relationships. By comparing it with a plot from 'Love in the Time of Cholera,' the author further examines the nature of pain—rooted in fear of the unknown and resistance to growth. Ultimately, the author recognizes pain as part of growth: just as Suletta must endure pain to become independent, they too draw nourishment from real-world setbacks and continue moving forward."

This article is a reflection on Suletta's emotional journey in *The Witch from Mercury*. Full spoilers ahead (including for *Love in the Time of Cholera*).

While I also believe the progressive nature of *The Witch from Mercury* stems from its depiction of a world where right-leaning capitalist society has developed to an extreme, with conflicts that provoke deep thought—and even the seemingly absurd school sections are filled with satirical education for the audience—that is not today's topic.

## Describing the Pain

It was so painful. That was my strongest feeling after watching S2 Ep5.
It felt like being caught in a Data Storm, like something was about to shatter.

It's now half an hour later, 1:15 AM.
I'm holding my head, hands rubbing through messy hair. My eyes are wide open, aimlessly staring at the pattern on the mousepad. I have to force myself to take a breath every now and then to avoid feeling suffocated. I've been in this daze for over half an hour.
It's not a dull ache, not "Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine." It's pure pain, causing the dam of emotions in my heart to burst, releasing my own inner pain along with it.
I want to cry out loud, but not a single tear comes to help me release this emotion. So it scorches me, reverberating within this body, creating wave after wave of more painful aftershocks.

As for the reason for the pain?
—*The Witch from Mercury* itself is emotionally impactful enough. When I came to my senses and searched online, trying to grasp something, people online were always joking, explaining it as "slaughtering the yuri fans."
—Is it my own emotions, the experiences of this past year?
My mind is weak, my thoughts sluggish. This pain still courses through my heart. Do I even have a heart?
But if I don't think this through a bit tonight, I probably won't sleep. Then, with severe sleep deprivation, a more vicious demon will be unleashed by the next afternoon: I'll lose the ability to work as dusk approaches, lose the will to sleep, lament another day gone, despair as the sense of meaning fades again, and waste more time—time that could have been used for something at least slightly better than the above.

I am deeply aware of the impermanence of the world; I know the buildings of this city are so dark that emotional projections dissipate into that darkness; I know the sense of powerlessness caused by my own weariness and laziness; I know everyone in this world must grasp something to construct their daily lives, and these daily lives are built around their own traumas—just as I am now desperately trying to grasp this article, not wanting it to abandon me.

So I forcefully steady my emotions, struggling from a puddle of mud瘫在床上 to sit back in front of the computer. I don't want to become Lady Melancholy's trophy to be hung up, at least not while I'm young.

Writing this far, aside from a small lump of charcoal-like substance in my chest still scorching, the situation is much better.

## Examining the Pain

Let's use the reflections on *The Witch from Mercury* as a线索.

From S1 Ep11, the protagonist Suletta experiences an existential crisis: she begins to move from a state of "being-in-itself" towards "being-for-itself"—from initially just wanting to扮演成正常人 (complete the wish list), to later becoming human because she gradually builds connections and has people she cares about.

Because she has people she cares about, she is no longer "自在," no longer in a carefree state. The纯白如纸 Suletta begins to be shaped.

Because she has people she cares about, she must offer her heart to them. This heart is pure, yet also fragile and sensitive.

And so, discovering that she似乎会错了意, that the reality seems to be that she is not needed or cared for by anyone, that no one noticed she was hungry even without getting a lunchbox, fear takes over, and she cries alone in a bathroom stall.
At this point, Suletta despises this pain. How we wish to undo the things that cause pain when we are in pain! But since the pain is already here, would悔棋 solve the problem? No. Not even destroying the world would solve it.

Here, I'd like to digress,抓住这一丝灵感 to剖析 this night-like pain. Like the end of *Love in the Time of Cholera*, where the bachelor finally pursues his beloved after fifty years, I have felt since first reading it four or five years ago, and still feel emotionally today, that this is the cruelest thing—the美好的青春 is already gone, the沧桑的心灵 is riddled with holes, and the one now沐浴着夕阳 on the ship is no longer the romantic少年 who once communicated through love letters.
That少年 died, died in Fermina's一次又一次冷酷的拒绝, died in the空虚的幽会 with one lover after another, died in the遗憾 of the黑女孩's misplaced time. I too once held my head and wept for it, mourning that time, mourning that dead少年. To this day, I can still hear my own sobs after finishing the book alone on another summer night.
Only now do I understand: this is the哀鸣 of the dead少年, not the哀鸣 of the bachelor over seventy. Perhaps my偏执 prevented me from seeing what the author clearly wrote: the bachelor is沐浴在夕阳之下 with a sense of圆满的爱意.
It was only because I was too young then, too young to follow the thread of time even in a book, to understand the bachelor's fifty-three years, seven months, and eleven days of日拱一卒.
Thinking of this, I have clarity. This part of the pain can be定性: What if the少年's future is not an Odyssean hero's journey, but a gradual withering and颓唐 like linking the fire in Dark Souls? This is pain born from fear of the unknown.
But the future never reveals its form. Whether it's Odyssey or Dark Souls remains unknown. So the少年 moves forward cautiously, in the light of hope, under the shadow of fear.

And Suletta encounters her first existential crisis, so she instinctively wants to return to the母体 state, to confide in her mother.

Until Suletta's症结—the person she cares about—comes to save her, tells her that she needs Suletta, and蛮横地 demands that she "always stay by my side," "don't lose any duels," "add more培养土 to the tomatoes," "clean the room twice a week," "send three text messages a day." Only then does that柔软的少年心 find relief from the pain, being小心地呵护了,而不是被肆意践踏个稀碎.

As a viewer, I felt强烈的共情 at this moment because I've had such moments too—being rejected, being needed. Simple, decisive resolutions are always爽快, and this time it was真心换真心,真真的好甜呐.

But Lady Malancholy always arrives unannounced.

> In the very temple of delight, veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine.

The少年终究还是渐行渐远, because the少年不明白 why童话故事 always end with "happily ever after," while life never stops.
At this最甜蜜处, I began to worry for Suletta.炽热的爱恋 will cool down,甜蜜的烦恼 might eventually只剩下烦恼. And Suletta only has甜蜜,没有烦恼. She can't even be independent, can't leave her mother or Aerial or the person she cares about. She hasn't yet become a true human individual.

Therefore, at the end of S2 Ep5, it is一并奉还. One must endure pain equal to this sweetness to bear its sweetness.
Being told she was used, being stripped of the school uniform representing honor, being定性为 the乡下女孩 from Mercury—being humiliated, humiliated by reality, humiliated by the person she thought could shelter her heart,绝望地嘶号, unable to lift her head.

Even understanding from a god's-eye view that the purpose of this is to sever the umbilical cord of the巨婴 Suletta, this pain依然以大剂量投射到我身上,以至于 writing this now, I still can't stop trembling, can't even type properly.

Why is it so intense?

Choosing to进取, one is bound to get灰头土脸. Suletta,尽管被保护地很好,天真到了变态的地步,尽管 she never thought about the meaning of piloting a Gundam, just as she never thought about the consequences her choices might lead to, still颤巍巍选择进取 within her own小格局.

Perhaps the情感的投射 comes from here. A year ago, when I chose to resign from the big tech company and start a business, I also couldn't foresee the翻天覆地的变化 in life this year would bring: starting to feel the loss of security from a salary in the second month after leaving, the sense of defeat from rapid initial success in创业 followed by even faster failure, and the ensuing personal financial crisis; I started feeling不好意思跟奶奶打电话了, then艰难地拾起失败 from that wave of failure,总结教训,开始慢慢夯实基础,试图让一切变得好起来.
Before starting, I always thought创业 must be轰轰烈烈 every moment, that people would be无限亢奋 like pumped with adrenaline. I also thought I was prepared to face any困难, but I never imagined how "any困难" would strike me重击 in every aspect of human life.

归根结底, I rarely细想 my own处境, and was even mocked by someone I care about for my "不切实际的乐观," because I still feel that things not yet concluded cannot be judged. But I couldn't免不了 possibly咀嚼 these失落 in the depths of my subconscious in dreams,以至于 upon seeing Suletta重重跌倒 in this episode, I破大防, then pulled out these words from my mind.

Like Suletta, I带着我的变态的天真 plunged into the soil of reality and was immediately修枝剪叶头破血流 by reality's剪刀; like Suletta, I扎进了现实的泥土,虽然头破血流,但在泥土中就有肥沃的养分可以吸收; like Suletta, I also have people who呵护我. Unlike Suletta, my life is not a 24-episode TV drama that must end with "happily ever after" or death within 24 episodes.
