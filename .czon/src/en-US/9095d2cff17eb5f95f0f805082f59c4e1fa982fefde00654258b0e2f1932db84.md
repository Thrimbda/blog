In 2016, during my sophomore to junior year, my monthly living allowance was 1,000 yuan, and my girlfriend at the time had 1,200 yuan per month.

Her school was in the far southwest of Chang'an District, mine was in Shapo Village, and we met every week.

There was a Holiland bakery outside the southeast gate of our school. She was a girl from another school, and when she came to visit me on weekends, she said the half-baked cheesecake was delicious, costing eight yuan each. We could only afford to buy the two-pack. After buying it, we had to take the bus across the street, and we finished it bite by bite on the overpass.

Later, in my senior year, I found an internship paying thirty yuan per hour. With overtime and bonuses, my monthly income reached over ten thousand yuan—I had never had that much money before.

During the May Day holiday in 2018, I went alone to the school gate and bought a box of five. I took the same bus across the street and ate it all by myself.

Her graduate school was in Zhongguancun, my internship was in Wudaokou, and we never saw each other again.

The episode where I miss home the most 😭

Suddenly craving watermelon, I bought one online. It reminded me that every summer since childhood, my family had watermelon daily. As a kid, my parents would cut it for me to munch on; now when I go home, I sneak half from the fridge to cut and eat when I’m hungry at night.

Anyway, being home feels safe, like having a protective shield.

Just cut and ate the watermelon—it’s sweeter than every watermelon my parents bought this year, but I miss home so much 😭

Traveling with zl (Part 4) - Reunion After a Long Time

When over seven hundred days of oppressive time had crawled across the calendar, and a glimmer of light finally shone through my work life, I decided to end this long self-exile. I planned to cross the ocean at the end of September to visit ZL, whom I hadn’t seen for three whole years.

I don’t know when it started, but the beginning of my travels always seemed to happen after the journey had already begun. That is to say, there was no anticipation lasting one or two weeks before departure, no lying in bed at night imagining the wonderful things that would happen on this trip. It was just packing and leaving, and I was still solving work problems right before departure. This made the whole process too rational and lacking in emotion. This continued until I asked for a small bottle of wine on the plane. The warmth rising from my chest after drinking it dispelled the excess rationality. Only then did my anticipation for the unknown and my nervousness about reuniting with an old friend I hadn’t seen in so long begin to dance in my mind.

After getting off the plane and exiting the station, I saw him. He had cut his hair short and was no longer skinny. Now he was a burly man with just the right hair length. Seeing each other, we couldn’t suppress our smiles as we gradually approached, and the old flames reignited. The outdoor air was a bit chilly, and we got into his small car.
Soon, after the joy of reunion subsided, I noticed—whether because it had been too long or due to the necessities of life in North America—that he seemed to have armed himself with a transparent shell, keeping me and all the unknowns of the world at bay. What he showed the world was an emotionally stable, burly man, but in certain moments, I could glimpse the youthful boy beneath that shell.
Fortunately, it was an unstable shell. In zl’s car, the scenery along the way quickly crushed the shell under the influence of time. Within 36 hours, we were chatting and joking like we did during those years in Suzhou, shamelessly commenting on every girl who passed by—except for Asian faces.

Among my many dreams of dissolving into the river and being forgotten by the world, one was to drive on the PCH while listening to Jaden’s song “PCH.” Before reaching Monterey, I mentioned this to ZL. Without a word, he found the song and put it on repeat. Under the clear sunlight, by the misty, blue sea, as the intro to “PCH” flowed out, the sea breeze took shape. We chased the constantly collapsing horizon, and the rolling wheels kept churning out new memories to patch over my lost dreams.

Sometimes the sunset was ahead of us. Fatigued by jet lag, I stared at the evening glow in silence while zl, who was driving, also remained silent. The twilight and lights fell on our faces as we drove toward the immortal sun under the gaze of the gods of dusk, and within that silence was an uninterrupted conversation. Then he broke the silence: “Tsk, gotta find a song that fits this moment,” zl said as he fiddled with the main control screen.


- P1: zl has many strange little gadgets. After entering his house, I found a small round sunglasses;
- P3: I brought the bottle of ice wine zl gave me five years ago to the U.S. and opened it with zl to drink;
- P7: zl said he really likes this photo, but it makes me look fat, so I don’t like it much;
- P9: Two weeks later, I stayed at zl’s place again for a night while transiting through San Francisco on my way home.

Traveling with zl (Part 3) - Let’s Go Cycling Around Qinghai Lake

In the summer of 2021, a few weeks before zl left for school, we agreed to go cycling around Qinghai Lake. The trip was six days and five nights, with four full days of cycling around the lake: a total of 360 kilometers, averaging 90 kilometers per day. As a result, I lost 5 pounds in the week after returning, even though my diet had returned to normal.

I had wanted to do another crazy travel plan like this since implementing one during the summer before starting university in 2014. Over the years, I had encouraged and called on every friend around me, and zl was the only one who showed great interest and responded enthusiastically.

We started from a bike rental shop in Haiyan County (I brought my own bike, and zl rented a touring bike) and cycled clockwise around the lake.

The sky and lake merged into one line under a clear, vast sky. As far as the eye could see, there was only the road stretching to the horizon. Under the expansive blue sky was an even bluer lake, next to which were vast fields of rapeseed. On the road beside the fields, there were only the two of us.
For four days, the world was compressed into the rhythmic pedaling of our left and right legs. Between heaven and earth, there were only the two of us, our tired bodies supporting endlessly active minds. We didn’t even have time to listen to music; our conversations were hard to end.

Qinghai Lake had been expanding for seven years. A statue that stood by the shore in 2014 was half-submerged in water by 2021. I wondered if, in my lifetime, Qinghai Lake would reconnect with rivers and gradually become a freshwater lake. Would we come back then? I didn’t dare hope to cycle around the lake again, but at least we could drink a large pot of milk tea in a tent. Then we could boast about how fun it was.

Only the severe migraines from altitude sickness that lasted almost half the journey, the continuous thirty-kilometer uphill climbs, occasional heavy rain, poor accommodation conditions, and the unique awkwardness of文艺小登 (literary youths) in their mid-twenties could add a little bitterness to this trip.

It’s worth mentioning that the cycling on the last day was accompanied by continuous heavy rain and endless uphill climbs. Our 24 Snickers bars were down to 6, and we were almost sick of drinking Red Bull. In the afternoon, I vaguely felt a chill at the base of my tongue and realized it was a bad sign. While resting 20 km from the finish line, zl’s sense of humor was still intact, leaving behind the masterpiece “c1 peeing picture.” Fortunately, a Tibetan truck driver asked if we needed help. The moment I sat in the warm, dry cab with the air conditioning on, I realized how cold I was. I shivered for another ten minutes on the road.

After returning to Xining, we devoured two pounds of hand-grabbed mutton. That was the last time I saw zl until this fall.

- We met a Hong Kong uncle with a flat tire. After helping him inflate it,
