The title describes a phenomenon that, while it may sound odd, is actually quite common—at least for me, ~~and surely for you all too.~~

This post was inspired by a moment of deep engagement in a lecture today, which was probably the most comfortable day of class I've had in a year.

## About Attending Class

It's been over a year since I last paid attention in class, mainly because I go to bed too late, get too sleepy during lectures, and over time, I just gave up. But today, on a whim, I decided to sit in the front row and listen, and surprisingly, it felt great.

## Reflections

I'm not sure if it's because I've accumulated a bit of experience lately or for some other reason, but I felt that both teachers in "Software System Analysis and Design" and "Software Testing and Evaluation" mentioned some viewpoints I strongly agree with. It's like learning the hard way and then coming back to fix things.

+ The concept of a system
+ The importance of system design
+ The importance of requirements
+ Always sign a contract for a project!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Alright, I don't want to write anymore because I've forgotten the question I wanted to discuss.

Sad.
