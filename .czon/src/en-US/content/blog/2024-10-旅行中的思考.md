Next, the author reflects on the current state and future of the NTNL venture, considering stable cash flow as the foundation and setting a goal to expand asset scale tenfold. To achieve this, deeper communication, continuous development of existing advantages, and balancing instrumental rationality with value rationality are necessary. Finally, the author shares views on anxiety, believing it stems from a desire for economic and cultural capital but can be transformed into motivation through proactive rest."

To my friend Chen Zheng,

## Thoughts and Expectations Regarding Work in the Near Future

I feel that my enthusiasm for work has recovered quite a bit lately. Let's spend some time later to adjust the Fountain strategy to its ideal position. Currently, the most urgent matter I see is the optimization of alerting and position adjustment methods.

1. The lack of alerts makes us less sensitive to risk exposure, affecting our motivation and confidence in adjusting positions and leverage to an ideal state.
2. The inconvenience of position adjustment makes it a troublesome and undesirable task. Imagine if adjusting positions were a very simple process.

In DevOps, there's a concept called DayN. Day0 refers to software design and planning, Day1 to implementation and deployment, and Day2 to ongoing maintenance and iteration. Applied to the Fountain strategy, we have clearly entered the Day2 phase—a boring, prolonged stage in my view. However, people, including myself, often overlook its importance and become numb over time.

Nevertheless, the recent break gave me some time to think and rest. Upon reflection, perfecting the Fountain strategy should be our most serious and essential task. After ensuring the existence of risk controls and the convenience of operations, we can free up our hands to explore boundary-expanding ventures like Meme.

## An Overall Reflection on Our Current State and Future

My expectation for the future (similar to our March outlook but with subtle differences, and aligned with my May thoughts with some developments) is that through the stable operation of the Fountain strategy, we can obtain continuous cash flow to support the expansion of other future ventures.

My assessment of our situation is that the most critical need is stable and sufficient cash flow: the basic requirement for maintaining the reproduction of our current living standards.

Next is elevating ourselves to a higher level. My vision for this higher level is: expanding the assets we can manage tenfold, reaching the tens of millions level—to achieve a certain degree of freedom. To accomplish this, we need to further develop the NTNL venture. In the thoughts I shared with you in May, I outlined several paths we have taken or considered for developing our venture, emphasizing the importance of allocating our energy wisely. Now, five months later, looking back, we have completed a shift in posture—from confusion to confidence: we have entered the Web3 field, adopted a more prudent and mature approach to managing our fund, and explored ways to further monetize Yuan as a product. These three points, I believe, are our advantages. Embarking on the journey is more important than reaching the destination; we can say we have completed the crucial starting point.

How do we further develop the NTNL venture? In my view, we need to do two things:

1. Deepen communication, enhance information acquisition, discover inspiration, and avoid working behind closed doors.
2. Patiently and consistently grasp and develop the advantages we already have (such as the three mentioned above).

The second point is a matter of mindset and attitude, which can be adjusted by shifting our perspective. The first point is necessary but currently lacking.

For example, the acquisition of these advantages stemmed from trial and error and serendipity over the past two years. We both feel that such favorable turns come too slowly. Why is that? "Learning without thinking leads to confusion; thinking without learning leads to danger." Our past practices failed to strike a balance between the two—we absorbed too little new knowledge while engaging in excessive, narrow-minded thinking. On top of that, there was a lot of numbness (at least on my part).

In September, we had a discussion where you mentioned that work should follow its natural course, not forced, and that happily wasting time is better than working in pain. I agree with this statement, but at the time, I felt something was missing. During that discussion, I couldn't precisely grasp what it was, leading you to misunderstand that I needed some pressure from you, akin to a challenge, which wasn't the case. Now, I'd like to add: besides the instrumental rationality of work attitude and methods you mentioned in daily life, we need value rationality to guide our direction. This value rationality is the further development of the NTNL venture to expand our asset scale, after which we can pursue a mission-driven venture. From this perspective of value rationality, we must balance our daily state, avoiding excessive anxiety and pain while maintaining some pressure and desire to drive our work.

## Some Other Casual Thoughts

This trip has been an excellent opportunity for me to reflect and clear my mind. Earlier, I mentioned anxiety. I'm not sure why I couldn't grasp it well enough before to describe it in words. In reality, the source of my anxiety is simple—it boils down to anxiety over insufficient capital, where anxiety and desire are two sides of the same coin:

1. Anxiety and desire regarding economic capital: Specifically, anxiety about a potential decline in social class and anxiety over insufficient confidence to ascend further.
2. Anxiety and desire regarding cultural capital: Desire for general social recognition and the desire to know more.

At its core, it's a longing for a certain kind of "freedom": the freedom to purchase things and the freedom to experience the existence of life.

These anxieties and desires can, in fact, serve as fuel to drive my life. Looking at it today, it's not that I'm overly anxious in daily life—I just needed a break to think and rest (laughs). In the future, I should rest more proactively. How can one work well without resting well?
