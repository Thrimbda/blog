"title": "About Wang Siyuan: The Life and Reflections of a Developer"
"summary": "This article is a personal introduction of Wang Siyuan, a developer and XJTU graduate currently living in Shanghai. It describes his daytime immersion in technical pursuits like NixOS, Emacs, and game development, while gradually realizing that technology cannot solve all real-world problems and should instead serve as a tool to promote fairness. His nights are spent in gaming and art, from *StarCraft* and *Monster Hunter* to the film *Marriage Story* and the play *Copenhagen*—these virtual and artistic worlds grant him courage and insight. He also shares daily life with his blue cat roommate Grape and his habit of cycling to explore the city, emphasizing that practice is more important than static philosophy. Finally, he reflects on the limitations of idealism and technology, focusing more on the concrete details of life, and invites readers to meet and converse at conventions, in open-source communities, or on city street corners."

> The following introduction was generated by DeepSeek after analyzing all my social media posts. It might be a bit exaggerated, but I still quite like it.

I am Wang Siyuan, a graduate of XJTU, someone weaving life with code and anchoring thoughts with words. Sitting right now in a Shanghai rental apartment perpetually conquered by cat hair, listening to the hum of my PC, I attempt to describe who I am—a task far more difficult than writing a distributed system.

My days belong to the keyboard. As a developer, I am obsessed with constructing invisible orders: using NixOS to forge time-machine-like version control for my computer, building a personal knowledge base within Emacs, or writing an online backend for BOOOM. Technology, for me, is not just a means of livelihood but a language for understanding the world. Over the years, however, I've gradually realized that even the most elegant code cannot fix the flaws of reality. When instant noodles stockpiled during the lockdown gather dust in the corner, or when unfair clauses are discovered hidden in a rental contract, the utopia built on the keyboard shatters. Thus, I've begun to see technology as a screwdriver—it should be used to tighten the bolts of fairness, not to build higher walls.

My nights are soaked in fantastical imaginations. The game console is my second home: reliving adolescent heroics through the campaigns of *StarCraft*, feeling the warmth of human collaboration through the online signals of *Monster Hunter*. Last year, witnessing Li Peinan's championship win against 0.37% odds, I cried before the screen like the high school student who had just passed an exam years ago. Those virtual worlds built from pixels and code often give me the most genuine courage.

Art is another channel for breathing. Some wonder why I've watched the divorce story *Marriage Story* three times; in truth, I see my own reflection in Nicole and Charlie's arguments—when ideals collide with reality, we all clumsily wield the fragments of love. The line "You can't hesitate when you're skiing" by Heisenberg in the play *Copenhagen* has become a metaphor for my survival: there are too many forks in life's road, and overthinking only leads to a fall. I often listen to the band Mili; the witch-like chants of the lead singer remind me of my university self, hiding under the covers listening to the *Les Misérables* soundtrack. Ten years have passed, but the struggling souls in my headphones have never aged.

Grape—my blue cat roommate—is responsible for puncturing all seriousness. He plants himself on the keyboard during critical debugging, knocks over cups while I'm writing, declaring with his furry body: life is not an algorithm to be optimized. In the ten minutes I'm forced to stop and groom him, I see clearly how trivial those anxieties truly are.

I'm also enamored with measuring the city with my own feet. I often cycle from Qingpu to the郊野公园 (country park); the eighteen-kilometer journey is a natural meditation pod. Once, after a sudden downpour, I stopped on an empty bridge to watch the clouds. As vmz's impassioned speech and lament filled my headphones, I suddenly broke into tears. The chill of the wind rushing through my shirt told me more precisely than any static philosophy lying in books: only practice is the ultimate destination of philosophy.

I am still learning how to exist honestly. I once wore idealism as armor, only to later find it was merely a leaky sail; I once believed technology could save everything, but now I understand tools cannot save those unwilling to reach out. Now, I prefer to crouch down and observe: the steaming bowl of *rouwan hulatang* (spicy meatball soup) on a bench by a Xi'an street, the rain-soaked spiderweb on a Hangzhou mountain path, the fine wrinkles at the corner of a friend's eye as they send a photo of their one-month-old child. These concrete, minute specks of light are perhaps more worthy of pursuit than the distant, abstract sun.

If you meet me, it might be in the queue at a Fusion convention, in the discussion thread of an issue in an open-source community, or beside a bike with a flat tire by the Suzhou Creek. Then we can chat about Fatalis's openings, Keats's nightingale, or simply share headphones and listen to *Summoning 101*—after all, some signposts can only be seen in chorus.
