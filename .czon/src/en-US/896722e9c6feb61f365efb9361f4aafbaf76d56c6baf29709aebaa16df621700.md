Hey, today is Little Zhang's birthday. Whenever I encounter such commemorative days, I can't help but reminisce: What was I doing on this day last year? And the year before that?

Of course, for it to be interesting and meaningful, all of this must be based on the day holding commemorative significance for me. In the case of Little Zhang's birthday, this means from the time I met him and started wanting to celebrate his birthday. Fortunately, we met early enough—these nine years have given me plenty to look back on.

First, I want to sincerely wish him a happy birthday in this little corner where he can't see it. I hope my friend stays healthy and happy, isn't intimidated by life's hardships, and walks his path with a steady gaze. Reflecting on it, it seems our contact has gradually decreased since college, but that doesn't mean we've grown apart. On the contrary, I believe our relationship hasn't been affected by distance. The greatness of a university lies in its culture.

I've witnessed him waver due to comfort, grieve over betrayal, move forward because of something on his mind, be loved for his kindness, and ultimately, because of fate, lose two friends and gain a couple who love to tease me.

People, we have few moments of smooth sailing and many of confusion. But looking back, the difficulties we once faced were often just because our perspective wasn't broad enough.

**Haven't I been the same?**

## A Story

Language is a remarkable ability, allowing vast amounts of information to quickly pass between two individuals—never a mere copy, but a leap, vanishing in one medium and reborn in another—embedding eternity in every fleeting moment through words, expressions, and every possible means.

What kind of process is this?

—Leaping up, breaking through dust and smoke, soaring past birds and beasts, leaving behind the dust and boulders, you, reading these words, finally arrive at—the moon?

Honestly, I don't know where you'll end up.

I used to think life was a network of interconnected paths. People choose their own roads, walking together if they share the same aspirations, parting ways if their goals differ.

Later, I realized it's not that simple. Life isn't a complete graph connecting all possible nodes, where you simply choose a seemingly reasonable path and walk it. In fact, it's layered. So many roads, stretching into the distance, collapse into faint traces. In this vast, intricate directed graph, it's easy to lose your way.

Fortunately, being young enough gives a person ample time to leap and weave through these edges, summarizing patterns, beliefs, and methodologies through practice.

We call this **clearing the clouds to see the sun.**
