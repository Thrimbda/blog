"title": "The Tree on the Mountain: The Yesterday and Today of Open Source Software"
"summary": "The article uses the Bus Factor mentioned by Henrik Lissner, the author of Doom-emacs, as a starting point to reveal the fragility of open source software due to reliance on key members, as seen in the Faker.js incident. Using Bourdieu's field theory, it explains that the open source spirit is essentially hackers pursuing cultural capital (such as reputation). As the software industry expands, open source inevitably merges with commercial logic, giving rise to two forms: traditional hacker-driven projects (like Linux) and commercially-strategic open source companies (like RedHat). The author argues this transformation is historical progress; the maturation of open source infrastructure will break the oracle of division of labor and foster tools accessible to all. Finally, it emphasizes that while heroes may fade, the open source spirit has taken root in reality, changing the world."

_And the more it wants to rise into the heights and the light, the more its roots strive earthwards, downwards, into the dark, the deep—into evil._

## Prologue - The (Supposedly) Fragile Open Source Software

Recently, Henrik Lissner, the author of doom-emacs, who had been absent for nearly half a year, spoke up in the doom-emacs Discord channel:

![image](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/08/27/doom.png)

<!--more-->

The gist is:

> Hello everyone! I've been away from the project and community for about a month, dealing with family matters. If you count the health, internet, and moving issues I had last year, it's been even longer. Worse, I didn't inform you about these things in a timely manner (or give a heads-up), and I want to apologize for that. Combined with several failed attempts over the past few months, I've started to make people worry about Doom's future and its Bus Factor.
>
> To be clear: I have no intention of abandoning Doom — it's just been an unfortunate and distracting two years for me — and I hope that's behind me now.
>
> After spending a week catching up, merging PRs, and updating modules, I'll post a larger announcement on Discourse detailing the current situation, the project's direction, and how I plan to address the bus factor and communication issues going forward.
>
> In the meantime, you can find me in the #development channel; if you have any questions about the project, or have recently sent me a DM/email (and are expecting a reply), or have any PRs ready to merge or needing my attention, feel free to reach out there.

Setting aside for a moment what doom-emacs is, Henrik mentioned a very interesting term: **Bus Factor**

Wikipedia's explanation of this term is:

The Bus Factor is a measurement of the concentration of information and capability within a software project team, also known by some as the "truck factor" or "lorry factor." It refers to the number of key members whose sudden absence ("hit by a bus," referring to any reason for absence such as career or lifestyle changes, marriage/parenthood, accidental injury or death, etc.) would cause the project to descend into chaos, paralysis, and ultimately fail to continue. This number is the bus factor.

A key member is interpreted as "indispensable to the project," meaning the project information they possess (e.g., design, source code, knowledge) is not widely known or shared by many other members. In a project with a high bus factor, even if someone suddenly stops participating, there are many other individuals who possess the relevant project information and can take over their position.

A low Bus Factor is actually a common ailment of many open source software projects. If you frequent GitHub, you'll likely have noticed many projects with high star counts being abandoned due to lack of maintenance.

The most extreme example is in early 2022, when Marak, the author of the well-known open source tool Faker.js, intentionally sabotaged the open source repository on GitHub, clearing all the project code and leaving the word "endgame" in a commit. As a result, front-end engineers around the world were confused to find their projects not working properly and displaying a large chunk of garbled code when they went to work that day.

_The "Endgame" garbled code_

Additionally, another library he developed, colors.js, was also affected. Both of these open source software libraries are foundational pillars in front-end engineering. For instance, colors.js alone has over 20 million weekly downloads on npm (you can understand this as meaning almost anyone doing front-end work uses it).

In 2020, Marak faced the predicament of his apartment burning down, leaving him homeless. The sponsorship he received from his open source projects was insufficient to support his daily expenses. His life became increasingly difficult, leading to the deeply regrettable and desperate decision he made in early 2022.

_To expand on this, there are many different perspectives on this incident:_
_- Some argue that if you don't want big companies freeloading off your work, you should use copyleft licenses like GPL or even AGPL, which are "viral," rather than the MIT License. The MIT License grants everyone the right to use your code freely from the start. However, whether a project would have the same influence today if it used GPL is another matter (commercial companies typically have their legal teams review open source dependencies before release to ensure there are no GPL-licensed dependencies, otherwise everything would have to be open-sourced)._
_- Others believe that as the project has developed, countless open source contributors have added code, making it a collective creation of the entire open source community. You don't have the right to turn everyone's hard work into shit._
_- There are also voices supporting Marak. For example, some say these parasites have been sucking our blood for too long; at least you made them feel the pain!_
_- Some also approach it from the license perspective. While people did contribute code, strictly speaking regarding the license, this was Marak's personal project. The MIT License, after granting all rights, also absolves the author of any additional obligations. Therefore, Marak is completely within his legal rights to do this._

There are quite a few similar regrettable incidents. For example, Marak, the protagonist of the Faker.js incident, mentioned Aaron Hillel Swartz, a genius programmer who participated in the development of the original RSS, co-founded Reddit, advocated for open knowledge, and actively opposed internet piracy bills. He practiced what he preached by using a guest account provided by an institution to systematically download academic journals from JSTOR on a large scale and make them publicly accessible. The U.S. federal prosecutor subsequently filed charges against him for two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He rejected a plea deal proposed by the federal prosecutor that would have had him serve six months in federal prison. Two days later, he was found dead in his apartment in Brooklyn, New York, having died by suicide.

Looking back at history, the open source spirit and open source software are perhaps one of the most incredible phenomena of our time:

On one hand, the open source software movement and the free software movement are themselves incredible. A group of intellectuals actively dismantle their own professional moats, often acting against commercial logic to practice the ideal of "all for one, one for all" and a vision of universal harmony. For what? Because the world should be that way, for the prosperity of society as a whole, because it's cool, and also because writing software itself brings infinite joy to its authors—I remember thinking when I graduated: Wow, I can get paid for writing code, my life is too good!

On the other hand, factually speaking, it's no exaggeration to say that open source software underpins the entire software industry today. The software industry has been utterly transformed by open source, to the point where MIT's famous introductory computer science course, 6.001—the famous SICP (**S**tructure and **I**nterpretation of **C**omputer **P**rograms)—has now been discontinued. Professor GJS said: "Modern software engineering has become so complex that it resembles science more than engineering, because no one needs to build large systems from scratch anymore—and very few people have the ability to do so."

You might sigh and say, for things to have turned out this way, for idealists to have such experiences, it's truly the shattering of ideals!

**But is that really the case?**

## The Dynamics of Open Source Software

Idealism is good, but ideals must be rooted in reality to take root and sprout. Let's bring in Bourdieu's sociological theory of "field-capital-habitus" to better explain all of this.

_[(Habitus) (Capital)] + Field = Social Practice_

Simply put, think of a socially constructed space (field) centered around a specific theme as a kind of game, and each of us is a player.

As players, although we often feel like free agents on an experiential level, the various decisions we make every day are often based on predictable, prescribed behaviors and the attitudes of others—that is, a habitual strategy formed through interaction with the game itself—a habit (habitus).

Under the influence of this habit, we engage in games and struggles according to the rules of the game and the strategies we adopt, based on our current position (capital), to occupy a more advantageous position within this game.

The entire organism of the above subjective and objective elements constitutes (via my unprofessional and extremely simplified summary of) Bourdieu's worldview of social science.

Returning from the game metaphor to the real world, similarly, no one can act without some kind of interest, and the goal of that action is most likely to increase the capital they hold.

You might think, if that's the case, then how do we explain the altruistic behaviors we see in production, practice, and daily life, the spirit of dedication in fields like art and science, and the open source spirit discussed in this article?

According to Bourdieu's definition, capital is not just economic capital; it should also include symbolic capital encompassing cultural capital, scientific capital, and other forms. Recognizing the existence of different forms of capital, Bourdieu does not believe there is any disinterested behavior in social production and life practices. From a perspective similar to game theory, he posits that all human actions are based on calculations of some kind of interest, aimed at seizing some form of capital—if not the economic capital we typically think of.

In different fields, different forms of capital play a dominant role—simply put, in academia, it's scientific capital; in art and cultural fields, it's naturally cultural capital. Different forms of capital in different fields have a certain "exchange rate," so we often see political or cultural elites leveraging their influence to acquire economic capital, and vice versa.

Here, I'd like to digress. The progressiveness of Bourdieu's theory, in my view, lies in the fact that all fields are created by humans, not emergent from human society. It explains why many phenomena are the way they are, while also implying that some seemingly entrenched ideas and social phenomena are not necessarily so. In other words, there is no purely "heavenly principle" that *ought* to be. This opens up the possibility of overthrow and progress; history has not ended.

![image](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/08/27/the-end-of-the-history.jpeg)
_So you're the one who thinks history has ended, huh? Now I'm telling you, the end of history has ended._

Returning to the topic, viewing the open source spirit through this theoretical framework can be explained as: within the field of open source software, hackers (please note, Hackers—people who enjoy challenging problems through intelligence and creativity—definitely not Crackers, computer criminals. The Chinese internet often confuses these two, stigmatizing the term "hacker") contribute open source code to the world in pursuit of cultural capital such as "reputation."

This is actually in line with a gift culture that often appeared in small hunter-gatherer groups before the advent of agricultural society. Supported by nature's abundant gifts, social relations were sustained by this gift culture, and tribal chiefs would often engage in public acts of charity. As the famous hacker culture anthology *The Cathedral and the Bazaar* says: within the field of open source software, there are no scarce "necessities of life." Early software was freely shared. This material abundance meant that the only measure of success was reputation among peers.

But hacker culture and software did not remain confined to a small, resource-rich circle. Contrary to Professor von Neumann's prediction that "the world would need only about five computers," software is indeed eating the world today. This is good; it shows that software plays an irreplaceably huge role in human production and life practices. On the other hand, under the influence of capitalism, the penetration of the software industry into other industries inevitably leads to the overlapping and merging of fields, forcing this industry to some extent to conform to the logic of the capitalist world—when computer technology and the software industry moved from the small-circle culture of well-off American middle-class hackers to the entire world, becoming an indispensable part of human production and life practices, the original core of the open source spirit was bound to be challenged.

Therefore, open source software was destined to move from its initial utopian, pastoral idyll belonging to a small group of technical elites to the masses, beginning to embrace the capitalism and commercial logic that supports the world's 7 billion people.

Countless histories have shown that the transition from one mode of production to another is inevitably accompanied by pain. But as historical materialists, we do not believe that moving from the Athenian democracy of ancient Greek city-states all the way to capitalism is a regression in history. On the contrary, it is tremendous progress.

## The Current State of Open Source Software and Its Typical Business Models

Since the former Microsoft, with its infamous "Embrace, Extend, Extinguish" strategy, strangled the then-star software Netscape to win the browser wars, leading to the rebirth of the Netscape browser as Mozilla Firefox (today's Firefox) and bringing about the open source movement; to the successful IPO of open source vendor RedHat in 1999; to today's "Microsoft Loves Linux" (TODO: image); to the proliferation of startups driven by open source software—I believe it can be said that at least up to today, even after embracing the capitalist commercial logic it once "despised," the open source movement is far, far from failure.

![image](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/08/27/landscape.png)
_CNCF landscape, listing the entire ecosystem of various software projects in the cloud-native field_

However, open source software has indeed diverged into two different forms:

The first is the original, utopian first-generation open source software, driven by hackers starting from their own needs, writing software and open-sourcing it for other hackers to build together. Famous examples that have stood the test of time, like Vim, Emacs, Python, Linux, and PostgreSQL, have basically become symbolic identifiers of open source software, revered and celebrated.

I got into Emacs because I thought Notion was just too good, so good that I started scrutinizing my own documentation tools, which led to a question: Do I really want to entrust these note data that might accompany me for life to this commercial company that, while extremely popular, likely won't outlive me? I then deliberately explored and started using Emacs' Org-mode for note-taking and task management, only to find that for me, Org-mode is leagues better than Notion. However, such needs are relatively niche. Human demand for software is more about solving current problems faster, better, and cheaper, which gave birth to the second form of open source software.

The second is the newly emerged open source software (and the commercial companies behind them) driven by commercial logic. Beyond practicing the universal ideal of "all for one, one for all," they treat open source as a strategic consideration and market tactic. Examples today are numerous: MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Akka, RedHat, Ubuntu, GitLab, the HashiCorp stack, etc. Countless examples exist, and several proven, viable business models have formed around open source software. Today's entrepreneurs don't even need to convince VCs familiar with open source why open source startups can succeed. For example:

*   Creating distributions or solutions around upstream core open source software, selling licenses or software subscription services in exchange for ease of maintenance or software availability guarantees. Examples include Ubuntu and RedHat for Linux, various public cloud Kubernetes container services, and various public cloud database services (to the point where MongoDB was "freeloaded" into changing its open source license to prohibit commercial competition).
*   Open-sourcing basic features for free, while keeping advanced commercial/team features proprietary and paid. Examples include GitLab, InfluxDB, Grafana, Envd/Modelz, and the HashiCorp stack.
*   Providing consulting services around complex, large-scale open source software like Linux, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and Prometheus.

The reason open source business models can work is that software source code does not equal all the knowledge surrounding that software: including the software's design philosophy, the history of its architectural evolution, and most importantly, the operational knowledge for stable operation. This knowledge, crucial for upper-layer applications that need to run stably on it, is often held only by core developers, forming the basic logic for commercialization.

For example, it's clearly unrealistic for a company whose main business is not various public cloud services to build its own cloud infrastructure from scratch, starting with its own data center, just because it needs to use technologies like cloud servers, databases, and container services, instead of using public cloud services like AWS or Alibaba Cloud.

You might ask, since the business is different and the source code isn't a concern, does it even matter if the software is open source?

In these fields, if a commercial company wants to sell its own proprietary software—say, an operating system compatible with the POSIX interface protocol—it will inevitably face this question: What makes your software better than Linux, which has been tested for 30 years? We find that nowadays, no enterprise even attempts to compete with Linux; instead, everyone only works on differentiated parts.

I feel very excited about such changes in open source software and the software industry as a whole.
Why do I say that?

## Epilogue - The People's Historical View vs. The Hero's Historical View

Henrik, mentioned at the beginning of the article, is undoubtedly an inheritor of that star-studded utopian era in today's world, an absolute hero. It was Henrik's doom-emacs that gave me, a Vimer, a foothold in the world of Emacs, and even provided me with a documentation writing experience far better than Notion's. It was Henrik who led me to discover the magical NixOS, allowing me to completely bid farewell to endless system configuration and painful rollbacks.

Although regarding this small Bus Factor incident, Henrik stated he would absolutely not abandon Doom-emacs and promised to give the community an explanation. Sooner or later, however, heroes will fade. When that time comes, what should we, who follow in the footsteps of heroes, do?

![image](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/08/27/motoko.jpeg)
_The net is vast and infinite. I really like the ending where Motoko disappears into the network. The audience doesn't need Motoko as an idol, and Motoko doesn't need to bind herself with her ego._

In the field of documentation, from the thriving community of Emacs/Org-mode, tools and startups like LogSeq (seed round: $4.1M) have risen. In the shadow of Notion, star teams like the open-source AFFiNE (Pre-A round: tens of millions of dollars in funding) have been born.

Similar things are now emerging in various fields of the software industry, and all of this is built upon the solid infrastructure laid down by generations of open source software and idealist predecessors. The giants in this industry can almost no longer easily monopolize an entire industry as they could twenty years ago. I believe that with the further improvement of infrastructure, the false oracle of meticulous social division of labor will be broken in the future. Everyone will be able to freely use these tools to do something interesting.

Although heroes may fade, unlike some other tragedies in history, the people within the field of open source software have not betrayed their heroes. On the contrary, they have truly changed and transformed the world along the path pioneered by the heroes. Today, Microsoft, once the "enemy" of open source software, has become a practitioner of open source software and the open source movement.

The journey of open source software from the ivory towers of universities to the embrace of capital is a historical inevitability. The ideal of the open source spirit has not been extinguished by this transformation. On the contrary, it has given birth to a new world where people do not place all their hopes on heroes. May our ideals, like open source software, take root and sprout in solid ground, accompanied by the world's mire, drawing nourishment from it, growing strong, and becoming towering trees.
