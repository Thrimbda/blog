Based on the understanding of RBAC from the previous article and due to assignment requirements, I will create a simple Demo as a practical exercise in RBAC.

I have no intention of making the Demo overly complex. My goal is to illustrate the concepts, so it remains "small but complete."

So, what is the objective of this Demo, and what can it do?

<!--more-->

## Analysis and Design

To make it interesting and fully illustrate the concepts, my Demo will simulate a greatly simplified scenario from a StarCraft battle where each unit miraculously possesses subjective initiative, focusing on a Protoss player's perspective.

A good Demo needs a good name, so this Demo is called: **For Aiur!** (Aiur is the Protoss homeworld, and every Zealot says this passionate line when warping into battle: "For Aiur!")

In **For Aiur**, you lead your forces to produce enough Zealot warriors to destroy the Destroyer Amon and save the universe. If you don't have enough Zealots, you will fail, the stars will whisper, and all will be annihilated.

All of this is embodied in a RESTful service built with Python's Flask framework.

> In a real scenario, every subject except the player could be created, thus treated as a resource. To demonstrate RBAC, I've added the following constraints:
>
> - The few subjects provided in this Demo are unique and always exist, as if they were one-of-a-kind, thus eliminating any possibility of subjects being recursively created (e.g., a Probe can produce a Nexus, and a Nexus can produce Probes).
> - In reality, Gateways require Pylon energy to function, but this is not reflected here. I explain it as our Gateways receiving energy support from the Spear of Adun, the legendary Protoss mothership in synchronous orbit, thus treating Pylons only as resources providing population cap.

This battle scenario includes the following objects:

### Subject

- Player (you) - thrimbda
- Probe (basic worker unit, can gather resources and construct buildings) - probe
- Gateway (produces Zealots, a combat unit) - gateway

#### Role

- Archon (supreme commander, allocates all resources) - archon
- Crystal Collector (only Probes can take this role) - crystal_collector
- Portal for Zealot Warp-in (beacon supporting the teleportation of Protoss warriors) - portal
- Pylon Builder (with Pylons, we can have enough population cap to warp in Zealots) - pylon_transporter

### Resource

- Unharvested Crystal (used to build Pylons and warp in Zealots, initial value unknown)
- Harvested Crystal (used to build Pylons and warp in Zealots, initial value 0)
- Population Cap (provides energy for warping, i.e., what we call supply, initial value 0)
- Zealot (combat unit, the warriors you use to save the universe, initial value 0)

### Permission

> Since each operation on a resource is a permission, we won't list operations separately here but directly provide permissions and their descriptions.

- Harvest Crystal (up to 1000 units per harvest)
- Observe Unharvested Crystal (observe total amount)
- Status Report (report current resource quantities)
- Scout Amon's Strength (calculate required number of Zealots)
- Build Pylon (each Pylon provides 10 population cap and costs 100 Crystal)
- Produce Zealot (each Zealot consumes 2 population cap and 100 Crystal)
- Attack Amon (Victory or death!)

### SA

> The many-to-many relationships between Subject-Role and Role-Permission are represented using Python's tuple data structure, and the implementation follows this approach. Therefore, this application does not use a database.

```python
subject_role = (('thrimbda', 'archon'),
                ('probe', 'crystal_collector'),
                ('probe', 'pylon_transporter'),
                ('gateway', 'portal'))
```

### PA

```python
role_permission = (('archon', 'get_status'),
                   ('archon', 'for_aiur'),
                   ('archon', 'scout'),
                   ('crystal_collector', 'get_crystal'),
                   ('crystal_collector', 'crystal_status'),
                   ('pylon_transporter', 'get_status'),
                   ('pylon_transporter', 'transport_pylon'),
                   ('portal', 'transport_zealot'),
                   ('portal', 'get_status'))
```

### Overview

Overall, I used Python's Flask framework to build a RESTful-style service. The entire application does not involve a frontend, so there are no security issues like bypassing the frontend.

A key feature of this Demo is that it does not use a database. RBAC does not mandate database usage, and using a database in RBAC is an intuitive and natural choice. However, in **For Aiur**, we do not use a database; instead, we use files to represent the RBAC `Subject-Role-Permission` relationships. Databases themselves evolved from file systems. Using files here is because the system is simple enough, and it further reduces complexity to illustrate the concepts. The specific file format is shown in the SA and PA relationship descriptions above.

### About RESTful

Here's a brief mention of RESTful (**Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer).

As the name suggests, it's about the (resource's) representational state transfer.

In a web service, the services provided are the system's resources, represented as URIs, and the service forms are operations on resources (state transfers), represented as HTTP verbs. These concepts align well with the resources and operations in RBAC. Therefore, my task is to apply RBAC's permission management to the operations on resources in REST.

### Objects in RBAC

As seen in these two configuration files, besides SA and PA, we can implicitly derive S, R, P:

```python
# Derive S and R lists from the subject_role tuple above
subjects = list(set([item[0] for item in subject_role]))
roles = list(set([item[1] for item in subject_role]))
```

SE can be well-correlated with the session in a web application, serving as a temporary object for a subject during a login:

```python
# The subject logs into the Spear of Adun tactical management system API. Here, session is a global object in Flask, and its implementation details are not elaborated.
class SpearOfAdun(Resource):
    
    def post(self):
        args = self.putparser.parse_args()
        if args['subject'] is not None:
            abortInvalideSubject(args['subject'])
        if args['role'] is not None:
            abortInvalideRole(args['role'])
        checkRole(args['subject'], args['role'], subject_role)
        session['subject'] = args['subject']
        session['role'] = args['role']
        return {'message': 'login as %s using %s' % (session['subject'], session['role'])}, 201
```

Since subject-role modeling ultimately aims to isolate and assign permissions, ensuring proper use and protection of system resources.

In **For Aiur**, I treat permissions as internal attributes of the web API, for example:

```python
# API for warping in Zealots
class Zealot(Resource):

    def put(self):
        permission = 'transport_zealot' # Permission
        abortIfSubjectUnauthenticated(session) # Login verification
        checkPermission(session['role'], permission, role_permission) # Check if the subject in this role can request this permission
        args = self.putparser.parse_args()
        amount = nexus.transport(args['amount'])
        return {'message': 'transport %d zealot warriors, En Taro Tassadar!' % amount}, 200
```

In the two API classes used as examples above, each class exists as a resource in the system, and the provided HTTP methods are operations on the resources.

**Thus, all objects in RBAC are now present.**

### Business Logic

Since **For Aiur** is a real, playable online real-time strategy game API, it's necessary to explain its business logic:

The player's goal is: **Gather resources, build your base, and then create an army that strikes fear into your enemies to defeat the Dark One, Amon.**

The only condition to defeat Amon is to have a sufficient number of Zealots, which is a randomly generated integer between 20 and 100 by the system. Simultaneously, the system generates just enough unharvested Crystal for you to defeat Amon based on this number.

**Why just enough?**

Since warping in Zealots requires a sufficient amount of population cap and Crystal, and Pylons providing population cap also consume Crystal to produce. Therefore, if you build too many Pylons, although you'll have enough population cap, you will **lose this battle that decides the fate of the universe because you don't have enough Crystal to warp in Zealots**.

The entire logic is provided by an object whose lifecycle spans the entire battle. To prevent issues, I added thread locks to ensure each operation is atomic.

```python
# Since it's the core of the entire game, I call it the Nexus.
import random
from threading import Lock


class Nexus(object):
    _lock = Lock()
    crestalInControl = None
    crestalRemain = None
    populationCap = None
    zealot = None
    status = {}
    _amond = None

    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize object
        self._amond = random.randint(20, 100)
        self.crestalRemain = self._amond * 100 + (self._amond // 5 + 1) * 100
        self.crestalInControl = 0
        self.populationCap = 0
        self.zealot = 0

    def collect(self, amount=1000):
        # Harvest Crystal
        with self._lock:
            amount = min(amount, self.crestalRemain)
            self.crestalRemain -= amount
            self.crestalInControl += amount
            return amount

    def transport(self, amount=5):
        # Warp in Zealots
        with self._lock:
            capacity = self.populationCap / 2
            available = self.crestalInControl / 100
            amount = min(amount, capacity, available)
            self.zealot += amount
            self.crestalInControl -= amount * 100
            self.populationCap -= amount * 2
            return amount

    def build(self, amount=1):
        # Build Pylons
        with self._lock:
            available = self.crestalInControl / 100
            amount = min(amount, available)
            self.populationCap += amount * 10
            self.crestalInControl -= amount * 100
            return amount

    def forAiur(self):
        # For Aiur!
        with self._lock:
            if self.zealot >= self._amond:
                return True
            else:
                return False

    def getStatus(self, role):
        # Get status
        if role == 'archon':
            return {
                'crestalInControl': self.crestalInControl,
                'crestalRemain': self.crestalRemain,
                'populationCap': self.populationCap,
                'zealot': self.zealot
            }
        elif role == 'pylon_transporter':
            return {
                'crestalInControl': self.crestalInControl,
                'populationCap': self.populationCap
            }
        elif role == 'portal':
            return {
                'crestalInControl': self.crestalInControl,
                'populationCap': self.populationCap,
                'zealot': self.zealot
            }
        else:
            return {}


nexus = Nexus() # Instantiate object
```

## Conclusion

In fact, each battle in StarCraft II is a typical DAC (Discretionary Access Control) model: the player controls everything, and all operations in the game can be seen as transforming the two basic resources, Crystal and Vespene Gas (simplified here), into the resources the player needs (production units, combat units) and consuming the enemy's resources to win the battle. This shows that RESTful service concepts are very universal.

In the small game **For Aiur**, I solidified several roles to construct an RBAC model.

Through this practice, I gained an understanding of RBAC's application in a system, further learned about the excellent Flask framework, deepened my understanding of RESTful concepts, and gained a lot.
