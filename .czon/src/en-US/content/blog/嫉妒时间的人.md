"summary": "From the perspective of the protagonist Bryan, the article explores the non-linear, web-like structure of time and its interaction with the human heart and language. Through personal experiences and reflections, Bryan reveals how time influences one's inner world, particularly the intertwined emotions of curiosity and inferiority. He envies the imprints time leaves on others, yearning to understand the experiences of the soul across different temporal dimensions. The article further analyzes language as a carrier of the heart's encoding, examining how emotions are transmitted and interpreted across spans of time. Ultimately, Bryan learns to distinguish between what changes and what remains constant within time, resolving to face time's trials bravely and pursue the richness of the soul."

"Drink! Plasma Egg, it is the fate of your kind!" Bryan, having just finished his shower and refilled the water for Chisei on the floor, mustered his strength and spoke in a deep, resonant tone.

Plasma Egg and Bryan did not share a common language. In fact, between the two of them, only one could speak. Though it sounded a bit absurd, what Bryan said was at least true—who doesn't need water?

## Time Is Not a Flat Line

> Time was later proven not to be one-dimensional as people thought. Or rather, describing it merely as "one-dimensional" is insufficient to express its intricate, web-like structure.

If this secret were made public, everyone would surely think Bryan had gone mad.

But once the taste of truth is savored, it becomes irresistible. Even if kept as a secret locked away in his heart, never to be shared with another human, enduring immense loneliness, Bryan would still follow his curiosity to seek more evidence. After all, this truth was born in his mind, born from his memories—more precisely, born from another unspeakable secret deep in his heart. It was a terrifying [thought experiment](<https://0xc1.space/2018/08/13/Sleeping%20to%20dream/>) that left Bryan in a state of fear and anxiety for a full six months and forty days.

### The Human Heart

Yet, phenomena related to time are also connected to the human heart. As is well known, people imprison themselves (whether intentionally or unintentionally), keeping their hearts forever hidden from the light of day. Observing another's heart is even more impossible. We can only use language to project our hearts—from their rich, colorful, and complex states—onto a straight line and hand it to another person, then pray for their genius to restore our hearts, which have been distorted by this linear projection.

However, there are moments like this: our hearts inadvertently flicker into someone else's heart, or vice versa. At such times, expressions appear on people's faces—most often a smile, sometimes a bittersweet happiness. Because the heart is confined within a prison of its own design/making, the most cruel psychological states are curiosity and shyness. Bryan understood deeply the pain brought by curiosity about another's heart. Whether in sunshine or rain, one can only guess based on meager evidence. And shyness intensifies the pain of that curiosity.

### The Human Heart Encoded into Language

Fortunately, most of the time, things are not about pain.

Bryan sometimes tried to explain his understanding of time to others. For instance, the process by which one heart constructs another heart carried by language is not, in fact, an isolated point on a timeline as most imagine. Sometimes, a person's words can suddenly take effect years later, like finally obtaining the key to a puzzle. Thus, language, combined with the effect of time, moves freely through this world. Since people cannot foresee the future, it is difficult to perceive this effect. Even if felt, it is absolutely impossible to describe to another—the equation has already been introduced with too many unknowns.

For those who speak a language over a long period, they sometimes use the same, not necessarily correct, pattern to construct and interpret the hidden hearts within language. If one suddenly switches to another language, unfamiliarity with the language itself makes one involuntarily cautious, allowing language to connect more directly to the heart. Bryan had a foreign friend with whom he once sat around a bonfire. Their communication often made Bryan aware of this. However, compared to the role of language itself, the similarity of human hearts is the solid foundation of friendship.

### Time's Projection on the Human Heart

It is precisely because of this unknowability of the future, and the grasp and memory of the past existing at different points in the web of time, that immense differences and commonalities arise between people. **Therefore, Bryan envies time, or rather, envies the imprints time leaves on a person.** This envy is actually composed of two distinct emotions:

The first is the aforementioned curiosity. Curiosity about how many linguistic riddles this person has solved in different times, curiosity about what favors and reproaches time has bestowed upon another heart, making it rich and full (Exuberance). Curiosity about whether he, using the same time as a measure, could experience the sufferings and joys of another heart, and whether he, too, could become rich and full?

This leads to the second emotion: a deep sense of inferiority. Broadly speaking, lacking the effect of time means lacking countless keys—unable to unlock the secrets left in the language of those from the past, and unable to powerfully form new words and new language to encode his own heart in new forms. Narrowly speaking, due to the asynchronicity of time, the probability of influencing another heart through non-linguistic means is greatly reduced. —Bryan asked himself if he was ridiculously naive. Even now, I can understand a bit of this feeling of his.

In the end, Bryan decided not to be a coward. He began to learn to distinguish between what changes and what remains constant within time, and to believe that time would eventually make him rich and full as well.

### Time's Effect on the Human Heart

Before the impartial face of time, the power of relative effects begins to show: "Hidden melancholy has her sovereign shrine." This is almost the line of poetry Bryan has chewed over the longest. And as time passes, more and more keys become available to unlock parts of its mystery, allowing him to savor different nuances.

Bryan discovered that persistently tasting the flavor of melancholy within joy is a manifestation of consistency. Because only within the same frame of reference does the latter emerge from nostalgia for the former. In a book Bryan recently read, the time span of such consistency could reach as long as fifty-three years.

However, consistency is ultimately a precious quality. More often, as time flows, a person's heart changes. Simplified to the binary relative effect we're discussing, this manifests as joy becoming平淡 (flat/ordinary) with its increase, while melancholy diminishes with the passage of time. The most tragic scenario is when past joy turns into pain, and past melancholy loses all meaning. Bryan termed this change "betrayal."

He would never allow such betrayal of himself to happen again. But with the right rhythm, balance naturally appears, just like the eyes one sees on a poplar tree for the first time—those eyes, large and small! They are hard to see without a rich and full heart.

### Time Ends in Plasma Egg's Snoring

So, what exactly are the things that change within time, and what are the things that remain constant? If a friendship that once shared weal and woe now seems insignificant, can it be said that the hearts that existed in that period of time have died?

Or perhaps every person, every day, is a rebirth, carrying the memories of yesterday's heart, ~~using this discovery as a grand excuse for procrastination~~.

Plasma Egg ultimately accepted her fate and began to snore peacefully. Only then did Bryan realize that time had stopped.
