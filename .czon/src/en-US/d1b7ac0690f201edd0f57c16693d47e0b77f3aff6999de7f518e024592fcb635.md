**This article was born from my undying childlike curiosity.**

In April, during a trip, I had a strong urge to write a travelogue, which I first posted on Gcores. As per my usual routine, I would then tidy it up into a Markdown version and post it on my personal blog.

After finishing the edits, I discovered my blog was broken.

## The Old Blog

The trend of building personal blogs became popular in my department during my junior year of university. Seven years ago, [this](czon://5221db5c2766ca0baade64eb4959a1c4fb1596bf1294c20de8af0c1448781374) cringe-inducing article described my initial thoughts and feelings when I first built this blog.

As for the reasons, firstly, I wanted to push myself to write something; secondly, I wanted to get some hands-on engineering practice, combining some fancy, trendy technologies not taught in school; and having a domain name was really cool, at least I thought so.

Let's reenact the scene from back then:

---

After learning a tiny bit of something new, filled with excitement, I would hurriedly record my thoughts into a Markdown document.

After writing, I'd nonchalantly execute a few commands to push the new blog post live:

```shell
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "new blog! hahahaha"
$ git push origin master
```

Then, eagerly opening the CI interface—CI was still somewhat trendy back then, the DevOps concept having only been proposed a few years prior. On the CI log page, I'd wait for the entire blog, including this new article, to be built into a static HTML website, wait for Travis to push the build artifacts to the git repository using my key, and wait for Github to publish the build artifacts.

Finally, I'd navigate to my domain [https://blog.thrimbda.com](https://blog.thrimbda.com) and contentedly watch that new article appear at the very top of the page.

---

Over the years, this process became boring, boring yet consistently effective, until the day it finally failed.

## The New Blog

At the end of April, I retried the CI pipeline three times in a row, and all failed. A quick glance at the logs revealed that a certain dependency used for building seemed to have disappeared from the internet due to being too old. I realized what a vast time span seven years is in this industry—long enough for sandstorms to destroy castles and seas to swallow mountains.

So, during idle moments at work, with some not-so-exciting requirements in mind, I made a technology selection: **simple enough, convenient enough.**

This new blog was born. As per tradition, an introduction is in order:

- Chose [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) as the generator;
- Found a very simple yet quite nice-looking [theme](https://github.com/Speyll/anemone);

As a replacement for the old blog, this new one was complete.

## The Childlike Tinkering Process

Perhaps because it was new enough, or because the technology choices were simple enough, or maybe because the feedback loop in frontend work is short enough, coupled with inevitably picking up some frontend knowledge from working with Azheng, filling in the knowledge gaps I neglected in my freshman year, the process of tinkering with the blog became fun again.

Some tentative CSS style tweaks, adding a new gitcus, hosting the comment section on GitHub; I reached an agreement with my seven-years-ago self: coding and tinkering with engineering is indeed a joyful thing, the joy of labor, the joy of play.

I want to ride the tailwind of this joy to focus on (and indulge in) the technical process of moving my Gcores Talk to the blog.

### Data

During a previous exploration, I discovered that Gcores is incredibly friendly to web crawlers. Its data APIs are very uniform and expressive. For example, exploring my Gcores Talk:

![gcores-api-at-glance](https://0xc1.space/images/2024/06/18/gcores-api-at-glance.jpg)

Found that this is the API used to request Gcores Talk data:

```
https://www.gcores.com/gapi/v1/users/464460/recommend?talk-include=topic%2Cuser%2Chelpful%2Cpoll-options%2Crelated-content.radio%2Crelated-content.video%2Crelated-content.article%2Crelated-content.game%2Crelated-content.film%2Crelated-content.album%2Crelated-content.album-bundle%2Crelated-content.product%2Crelated-content.discussion&original-include=user%2Cdjs%2Ccategory&order-by=time&before=1718720726.986&fields[articles]=title%2Cdesc%2Cexcerpt%2Cis-published%2Cthumb%2Capp-cover%2Ccover%2Ccomments-count%2Clikes-count%2Cbookmarks-count%2Cis-verified%2Cpublished-at%2Coption-is-official%2Coption-is-focus-showcase%2Cduration%2Cdraft%2Caudit-draft%2Cuser%2Ccomments%2Ccategory%2Ctags%2Centries%2Centities%2Csimilarities%2Clatest-collection%2Ccollections%2Coperational-events%2Cportfolios%2Ccatalog-tags&fields[videos]=title%2Cdesc%2Cexcerpt%2Cis-published%2Cthumb%2Capp-cover%2Ccover%2Ccomments-count%2Clikes-count%2Cbookmarks-count%2Cis-verified%2Cpublished-at%2Coption-is-official%2Coption-is-focus-showcase%2Cduration%2Cdraft%2Caudit-draft%2Cuser%2Ccomments%2Ccategory%2Ctags%2Centries%2Centities%2Csimilarities%2Clatest-collection%2Ccollections%2Coperational-events%2Cportfolios%2Ccatalog-tags%2Cmedia%2Cdjs%2Calbums%2Cpublished-albums&fields[radios]=title%2Cdesc%2Cexcerpt%2Cis-published%2Cthumb%2Capp-cover%2Ccover%2Ccomments-count%2Clikes-count%2Cbookmarks-count%2Cis-verified%2Cpublished-at%2Coption-is-official%2Coption-is-focus-showcase%2Cduration%2Cdraft%2Caudit-draft%2Cuser%2Ccomments%2Ccategory%2Ctags%2Centries%2Centities%2Csimilarities%2Clatest-collection%2Ccollections%2Coperational-events%2Cportfolios%2Ccatalog-tags%2Cmedia%2Cdjs%2Clatest-album%2Calbums%2Cis-free%2Cis-require-privilege
```

#### Raw Data

Let's distill the information:

```ts
const user = 464460;

const url = new URL(
  `https://www.gcores.com/gapi/v1/users/${user}/recommend?talk-include=topic%2Cuser%2Chelpful%2Cpoll-options%2Crelated-content.radio%2Crelated-content.video%2Crelated-content.article%2Crelated-content.game%2Crelated-content.film%2Crelated-content.album%2Crelated-content.album-bundle%2Crelated-content.product%2Crelated-content.discussion&original-include=user%2Cdjs%2Ccategory&order-by=time&fields[articles]=title%2Cdesc%2Cexcerpt%2Cis-published%2Cthumb%2Capp-cover%2Ccover%2Ccomments-count%2Clikes-count%2Cbookmarks-count%2Cis-verified%2Cpublished-at%2Coption-is-official%2Coption-is-focus-showcase%2Cduration%2Cdraft%2Caudit-draft%2Cuser%2Ccomments%2Ccategory%2Ctags%2Centries%2Centities%2Csimilarities%2Clatest-collection%2Ccollections%2Coperational-events%2Cportfolios%2Ccatalog-tags&fields[videos]=title%2Cdesc%2Cexcerpt%2Cis-published%2Cthumb%2Capp-cover%2Ccover%2Ccomments-count%2Clikes-count%2Cbookmarks-count%2Cis-verified%2Cpublished-at%2Coption-is-official%2Coption-is-focus-showcase%2Cduration%2Cdraft%2Caudit-draft%2Cuser%2Ccomments%2Ccategory%2Ctags%2Centries%2Centities%2Csimilarities%2Clatest-collection%2Ccollections%2Coperational-events%2Cportfolios%2Ccatalog-tags%2Cmedia%2Cdjs%2Calbums%2Cpublished-albums&fields[radios]=title%2Cdesc%2Cexcerpt%2Cis-published%2Cthumb%2Capp-cover%2Ccover%2Ccomments-count%2Clikes-count%2Cbookmarks-count%2Cis-verified%2Cpublished-at%2Coption-is-official%2Coption-is-focus-showcase%2Cduration%2Cdraft%2Caudit-draft%2Cuser%2Ccomments%2Ccategory%2Ctags%2Centries%2Centities%2Csimilarities%2Clatest-collection%2Ccollections%2Coperational-events%2Cportfolios%2Ccatalog-tags%2Cmedia%2Cdjs%2Clatest-album%2Calbums%2Cis-free%2Cis-require-privilege`
);
```

Further observation reveals that pagination seems to be determined by a parameter called `before`. By continuously iterating forward with this timestamp parameter until no more data is retrieved, we can write code like this:

```ts
import {
  EMPTY,
  Observable,
  expand,
  map,
  mergeAll,
  mergeMap,
  of,
  shareReplay,
  skip,
  takeWhile,
  tap,
  toArray,
} from "https://esm.sh/rxjs@7.8.1";

const user = 464460;

const url = new URL(
  `https://www.gcores.com/gapi/v1/users/${user}/recommend?talk-include=topic%2Cuser%2Chelpful%2Cpoll-options%2Crelated-content.radio%2Crelated-content.video%2Crelated-content.article%2Crelated-content.game%2Crelated-content.film%2Crelated-content.album%2Crelated-content.album-bundle%2Crelated-content.product%2Crelated-content.discussion&original-include=user%2Cdjs%2Ccategory&order-by=time&fields[articles]=title%2Cdesc%2Cexcerpt%2Cis-published%2Cthumb%2Capp-cover%2Ccover%2Ccomments-count%2Clikes-count%2Cbookmarks-count%2Cis-verified%2Cpublished-at%2Coption-is-official%2Coption-is-focus-showcase%2Cduration%2Cdraft%2Caudit-draft%2Cuser%2Ccomments%2Ccategory%2Ctags%2Centries%2Centities%2Csimilarities%2Clatest-collection%2Ccollections%2Coperational-events%2Cportfolios%2Ccatalog-tags&fields[videos]=title%2Cdesc%2Cexcerpt%2Cis-published%2Cthumb%2Capp-cover%2Ccover%2Ccomments-count%2Clikes-count%2Cbookmarks-count%2Cis-verified%2Cpublished-at%2Coption-is-official%2Coption-is-focus-showcase%2Cduration%2Cdraft%2Caudit-draft%2Cuser%2Ccomments%2Ccategory%2Ctags%2Centries%2Centities%2Csimilarities%2Clatest-collection%2Ccollections%2Coperational-events%2Cportfolios%2Ccatalog-tags%2Cmedia%2Cdjs%2Calbums%2Cpublished-albums&fields[radios]=title%2Cdesc%2Cexcerpt%2Cis-published%2Cthumb%2Capp-cover%2Ccover%2Ccomments-count%2Clikes-count%2Cbookmarks-count%2Cis-verified%2Cpublished-at%2Coption-is-official%2Coption-is-focus-showcase%2Cduration%2Cdraft%2Caudit-draft%2Cuser%2Ccomments%2Ccategory%2Ctags%2Centries%2Centities%2Csimilarities%2Clatest-collection%2Ccollections%2Coperational-events%2Cportfolios%2Ccatalog-tags%2Cmedia%2Cdjs%2Clatest-album%2Calbums%2Cis-free%2Cis-require-privilege`
);

const imageUrl = (image: string) =>
  `https://image.gcores.com/${image}?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_90/format,webp`;

// pagination
url.searchParams.set("before", `${Date.now() / 1000}`);

interface IGcoresTalk {
  text: string;
  images: string[];
  published_at: number;
  tags: string[];
}

const rawGcoresTalkData$: Observable<any[]> = of({
  before: Date.now() / 1000,
}).pipe(
  // raw data
  expand(async ({ before }) => {
    url.searchParams.set("before", `${before}`);
    const res = await fetch(url);
    const data = await res.json();
    if (!data.data || data.data.length === 0) {
      return EMPTY;
    }
    return {
      before:
        new Date(
          data.data[data.data.length - 1].attributes["published-at"]
        ).getTime() / 1000,
      ...data,
    };
  }),
  skip(1),
  // debug
  // take(1),
  takeWhile((v) => !!v.data),
  // filter((v) => v.data.length > 0),
  tap((v) => {
    console.info(v);
  }),
  toArray(),
  shareReplay(1)
);
```

Now we have an Rx stream carrying all the raw Gcores Talk data for a user.

#### Processing the Data

With the raw data, the next step is to process it into Markdown. Let's start processing directly. The key points are:

- Decide what content to display.
- Understand the Gcores API fields.

Gcores Talk is similar to social media feeds like WeChat Moments or Weibo—text with images, plus some tags. Let's display them flatly.

The data for a Gcores Talk can be defined as follows:

```json
{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "data": { "spoiler": false },
      "depth": 0,
      "entityRanges": [{ "key": 0, "length": 1, "offset": 0 }],
      "inlineStyleRanges": [],
      "key": "7u4tf",
      "text": "-",
      "type": "atomic"
    },
    {
      "data": { "spoiler": false },
      "depth": 0,
      "entityRanges": [],
      "inlineStyleRanges": [],
      "key": "wisz4",
      "text": "核聚变好玩，和雨川西蒙合了影，见到了做志愿者的 merz，然而社恐差点没敢上前搭话，腿快走断了，给没能来的小朋友们买了点纪念品，Celeste 随机异变速通震撼我妈，全程硬是没把因为震惊而张开的大嘴合上。可惜周天广州下雨航班被取消所以急匆匆买了深圳回上海的高铁票就没去成周天的。",
      "type": "unstyled"
    },
    {
      "data": { "spoiler": false },
      "depth": 0,
      "entityRanges": [],
      "inlineStyleRanges": [],
      "key": "nzffe",
      "text": "",
      "type": "unstyled"
    },
    {
      "data": { "spoiler": false },
      "depth": 0,
      "entityRanges": [],
      "inlineStyleRanges": [],
      "key": "7f8m6",
      "text": "下次还来！",
      "type": "unstyled"
    }
  ],
  "entityMap": {
    "0": {
      "data": {
        "caption": "",
        "images": [
          {
            "path": "0ad6514d154c80a9ef6b4b0d6173d132-3024-4032.HEIC",
            "width": 3024,
            "height": 4032
          },
          {

            "width": 4032,
            "height": 3024
          },
          {
            "path": "aedf102fa319ce3df2438386f894
