# Investigating CZON Embla Carousel and Modifying get-gcores-talk.ts - Context

## Session Progress (2026-01-15)

### ✅ Completed

- Investigated the implementation details of CZON's Embla usage.
- Analyzed the structure and templates of the existing blog slider.
- Determined the integration plan to replace the existing slider with Embla.
- Modified `get-gcores-talk.ts` to output flat markdown image rows.
- Added the Embla library loading script to `head.html`.
- Added Embla initialization JavaScript code and CSS styles.
- Modified the `slideshow` shortcode to output Embla-compatible structure.
- Commented out old slider initialization code to avoid conflicts.
- Successfully built the blog and verified basic functionality.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Reason | Alternative | Date |
|------|------|----------|------|
| Replace the existing slider implementation with Embla to standardize the carousel solution. | User requested rendering with Embla, and the existing slider implementation might conflict with Embla's grouping logic. Standardizing on Embla simplifies the codebase, improves consistency, and leverages Embla's rich feature set. | 1. Coexist but restrict Embla to flat images only; 2. Keep the existing slider and only modify the `get-gcores-talk.ts` output format, but the Embla script might break the existing slider's DOM structure. | 2026-01-15 |
| Comment out old slider initialization code to avoid conflicts with Embla. | The old slider code looks for `.slider`, `.slider-item` elements, but the `slideshow` shortcode now outputs Embla structure, potentially causing conflicts or errors. Commenting it out ensures only Embla is used. | 1. Delete the old code entirely; 2. Keep it but add conditional checks; 3. Modify the old code to adapt to the Embla structure. | 2026-01-15 |
| Further debugging needed for Embla initialization issue; images are not rendered as a carousel. | The test page shows images within the same `<p>` tag, but the Embla script is not adding the `embla` class, possibly due to library load failure or initialization error. | 1. Add debug logs to check Embla library load status; 2. Simplify initialization logic; 3. Check CDN link availability; 4. Modify grouping algorithm for robustness. | 2026-01-15 |

## Quick Handover

**Continue from here next time:**

1. To fully restore image download functionality, uncomment the `delayWhen` block in `get-gcores-talk.ts`.
2. Test the carousel functionality in a real browser to ensure Embla works correctly.
3. If other articles use the `slideshow` shortcode, verify their display.

**Notes:**

- Image download functionality in `get-gcores-talk.ts` is temporarily disabled to speed up testing.
- Old slider code is commented out but not deleted, and can be restored if necessary.
- Embla's grouping algorithm is based on image continuity in the DOM and might need adjustment for complex layouts.
