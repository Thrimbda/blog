# Ascending the Yuedu Pavilion

Peaks gather like a throng, waves rage like fury,
Mountains and rivers guard the Tongguan road.

From the Yuedu Pavilion, the eight-hundred-li Qin Plain unfolds before the eyes:

Behold—paths crisscross the fields, cocks crow and dogs bark,
The winds are favorable and rains timely, the land is blessed with outstanding talents!

To the north, it gazes upon the vastness of the Loess Plateau;
To the south, it faces the majestic grandeur of the Qinling Mountains and Mount Hua.
Nourished by the mighty, surging Wei River,
It has fostered the splendid and magnificent civilization of Huaxia!

May we rise with the rooster's crow and strive for progress,
Carrying forward the past and opening up the future!

How fortunate I am to express my aspirations through this song.
