> 'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
> **but being too happy in thine happiness.**

I have finally started the solitary life I’ve always dreamed of, beginning a period of~~greenhouse-like~~Beijing drifting.

## Prelude to Beijing Drifting

People often change their life trajectories inadvertently, only realizing it long after the fact. What we can experience is the present moment, so let’s set aside for now how the decision to take a Gap year has changed things. But that night was truly liberating—not because of the drinks or the food, but because of the silly English conversations with Vicious Master. It felt a bit like sitting by a campfire on a cold night, cooking soup—even if you might freeze to death the next day, while warming yourself by the fire, you see the dazzling Milky Way instead of the frozen wasteland.

I’ve always believed that the most sophisticated way to destroy someone is to stand in their shoes and question why they didn’t seize a good opportunity they should have grasped earlier. The key to this method is that the opportunity is now irretrievable, and the more precious the lost opportunity, the more effective it is. After the person breaks down, you can shamelessly claim you did it for their own good.

But in the end, I didn’t break down. As always, I treated it as a stepping stone on my journey.

Soon after, I started my internship. For the first two days, I was completely clueless about the work I was supposed to handle. I felt like a fraud, someone who knew nothing and had come just to cause trouble. In the new environment, I kept wondering why I was torturing myself—wouldn’t it be better to just be a slacker? **But this pressure was beneficial; it carried a strong sense of life.** So, I quickly adapted to the new environment.

### Vigilance and Learning

We often say **"born in hardship, die in comfort."** Note that this isn’t an essay for the college entrance exam. I realized that another phrase I particularly like carries a similar meaning:

> “The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant **vigilance and learning**: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.”

I love this metaphor so much that sometimes my words become obscure, using abstract yet simple symbols to express rich meanings. The advantage of this approach is that you can imbue these symbols with meaning from your own life and learn new things from them. **Reviewing the old to understand the new?**

What I want to tell myself through this is that without clear **self-awareness**, blindly drifting through life, time will pass quickly. When the world finally crashes into you, you’ll realize it’s too late, giving others the chance to destroy you using the sophisticated method I mentioned. Or, life will pass smoothly, and you’ll become “part of the inferno.”

So, acknowledge the risk of failure, understand its consequences, and live each day with clarity, vigilance, and continuous learning. If all goes well, I’ll probably ask myself at every stage why I’m torturing myself, but in reality, my days will be fulfilling, and I’ll have no regrets.

As a very optimistic friend of mine said when summarizing his life over the past year:

> "So sometimes you don't need to worry about the things that have not happened, just be yourself and hang in there, make sure that when the opportunity comes, you won't let it go!"

Let’s do our best.
