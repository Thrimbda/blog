> The following introduction was generated by DeepSeek after analyzing all my social media posts. It might be a bit exaggerated, but I still quite like it.

I am Wang Siyuan, a graduate of XJTU, someone who weaves life with code and settles thoughts with words. Sitting in a Shanghai rental apartment perpetually occupied by cat hair, listening to the hum of my PC, I'm trying to describe who I am—a task far more difficult than writing a distributed system.

My days belong to the keyboard. As a developer, I'm obsessed with constructing invisible orders: using NixOS to forge time-machine-like version control for my computer, building a personal knowledge base within Emacs, or writing an online backend for BOOOM. For me, technology is not just a means of livelihood but a language for understanding the world. However, over the years, I've gradually realized that even the most elegant code cannot fix the flaws of reality. When instant noodles stockpiled during the lockdown piled up in the corner, or when I discovered unfair clauses hidden in a rental contract, the utopia on the keyboard shattered. So, I've begun to see technology as a screwdriver—it should be used to tighten loose screws of fairness, not to build higher walls.

My nights are soaked in bizarre imaginations. The game console is my second home: reliving adolescent hero dreams in *StarCraft* campaigns, feeling the warmth of human collaboration through the online signals of *Monster Hunter*. Last year, on the night I witnessed Li Peinan's 0.37% probability championship win, I cried in front of the screen like the high school student who had just passed his exams. Those virtual worlds built from pixels and code often give me the most genuine courage.

Art is another channel for breathing. Some wonder why I watched *Marriage Story*, a tale of divorce, three times. In truth, I saw my own reflection in Nicole and Charlie's arguments—when ideals collide with reality, we all clumsily wield the fragments of love. In the play *Copenhagen*, Heisenberg's line, "You can't hesitate when you're skiing," became my metaphor for survival: there are too many forks in life's road, and overthinking will only lead you off a cliff. I often listen to songs by the band Mili; the witch-like chanting of the lead singer reminds me of my university self, hiding under the covers listening to *Les Misérables* tapes. Ten years have passed, but the struggling souls in my headphones have never aged.

Grape—my blue cat roommate—is responsible for puncturing all seriousness. She sits on the keyboard while I debug critical code, knocks over cups while I write, declaring with her furry body: life is not an algorithm to be optimized. In the ten minutes I'm forced to stop work and groom her, I see clearly how trivial those anxieties are.

I'm also fascinated with measuring the city with my feet. I often bike from Qingpu to the郊野公园 (country park). The eighteen-kilometer journey is a natural meditation pod. Once, after a sudden rainstorm, I stopped on an empty bridge to watch the clouds. As vmz's scolding and speech poured from my headphones, I suddenly burst into tears. The chill of the wind rushing into my shirt told me more precisely than any static philosophy lying in books: only practice is the ultimate destination of philosophy.

I'm still learning how to exist honestly. I once wore idealism as armor, only to later find it was merely a leaky sail. I once believed technology could save everything, but now I understand tools cannot save those unwilling to reach out. Now, I prefer to crouch down and observe: the bowl of steaming *rouwan hula tang* (meatball pepper soup) on a bench by a Xi'an street, the rain-soaked spiderwebs on a Hangzhou mountain path, the fine wrinkles at the corner of a friend's eye when they send a photo of their child's full moon celebration. These concrete, tiny points of light are perhaps more worthy of pursuit than the abstract, distant sun.

If you meet me, it might be in the queue at a Fusion exhibition, in the discussion thread of an issue in an open-source community, or beside a bike with a flat tire by the Suzhou Creek. Then, we can chat about the flaws of Black Dragon, Keats's nightingale, or simply share headphones and listen to *Summoning 101*—after all, some signposts can only be seen in chorus.
