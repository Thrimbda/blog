The internship is nearing its end, and the coding for the basic version of the backend API server is essentially complete. I'd like to summarize my experience here.

As the project team lead, my only knowledge about software project management came from reading *The Mythical Man-Month* once during the winter break. Through this practical experience, I realized I was still too green. Nevertheless, I believe I have learned a few things.

## Design

Compared to two years ago when I would fire up Visual Studio without a second thought to write C language assignments, I have clearly changed somewhat today.

~~First of all, I haven't opened VS in a long time.~~

In any case, over these two years, I've gone through various concentrated coding experiences: the practice during the naive and pure period of learning Python, the training from writing the upper computer software for the robotics team, the experience of writing crawlers for the teacher/student portals of the academic affairs website, and developing the file management tool while participating in the Orange Juice project. At the very beginning, I certainly just charged ahead recklessly, but I suppose after suffering enough from inconsistencies, one learns the importance of upfront design. Once you step through the door of design, the next question is the degree of it—therefore, this experience of overseeing the entire project served as a very beneficial exercise.

**First, clearly define what to do.** This question is crucial for a team genuinely wanting to build a product: **defining your own product** is a strategic-level task. However, it's a pity we didn't have any particularly interesting ideas this time. With responsibility on my shoulders, my expectation for this internship was to seriously create a reliable, simple project.

In short, it's a **traditional web application with WeChat Mini Programs as its flagship feature**—specifically, a goal management system.

Far too many people have built this kind of thing, so modeling the tasks we would face could draw from many mature solutions: tools like Worktile for project orientation; WonderList for personal life management; My Study Life for students; even Apple's `Reminders` and other tools I've heard of but haven't used. Synthesizing the characteristics of these tools, we aimed to distill a classic, WeChat-flavored goal management system—this became our `Seed`.

### Features It Should Have

So what should `Seed` be able to do?

+ Have a simple user system for easy synchronization and to increase user stickiness.
+ Users can freely create and manage goals, similar to `projects` in Worktile.
+ Users can be invited into other people's goals.
+ Goals are categorized into daily check-in types (recurring) and project攻坚 types (one-time, can incorporate milestones).
+ The flagship frontend is the WeChat Mini Program.
+ Also compatible with other potential clients.

From this perspective, `Seed` should be a small, lean, and practical service, which aligns perfectly with the original intent of WeChat Mini Programs.

It's necessary to emphasize the characteristic of being **"small and lean."** Why small and simple? First, limited manpower and time. Second, to avoid the mistake often made by `second projects` mentioned in *The Mythical Man-Month*: blind arrogance,疯狂地 adding endless redundancy to a project. This is a thankless and foolish endeavor, especially since—we are not dealing with advertising revenue. A simple example: Mac OS版迅雷 vs. Win版迅雷, obviously everyone prefers the lean and usable Mac version.

It must also have good compatibility with WeChat Mini Programs. To provide a smooth user experience, it should support both email as a user login name and WeChat openId as a login credential.

### System Structure

As mentioned above, we aim to build a web application with WeChat Mini Programs as its flagship feature. This means `Seed` has the capability ~~and ambition~~ to be compatible with other frontends. Therefore, a RESTful-style API became the best choice: complete decoupling of frontend and backend, clear structure, and convenient consumption.

Thus, `Seed` should be a system where WeChat Mini Programs and other potential forms act as the frontend, consuming `resources` provided by the backend via the HTTP protocol.

The backend provides secure and reliable services through APIs.

I also learned a bit about this, encountering the concept of HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State). Although not yet mature, it represents a possible future.

## Implementation

Since I only participated in the coding of the API server, I will only discuss the backend implementation here.

I like to categorize design as the strategic level (the "Tao" or Way), and the remaining work as the tactical level (the "Shu" or Technique). Therefore, choosing which technologies to use and how to specifically implement a system falls into this category.

### Technology

Due to internship requirements and a desire to use the Java language appropriately, I chose the `Spring Framework` as the backend framework,顺便 using the Spring ecosystem:

+ Spring Boot as the application container
+ Spring Framework for implementing business logic
+ Spring Data as the DAO
+ Spring Session for managing sessions
+ Spring test for testing

Additionally, tools like Git, TravisCI, and Heroku were used to improve the development experience.

### Development Process

As mentioned before, the experience of writing Spring Controllers is very similar to that of the Python Flask web framework. Perhaps Flask drew some inspiration from Spring? Resource-oriented controller classes seem much more compact compared to the traditional Java Web approach of writing a Servlet for each resource.

Spring advocates Test-Driven Development. Actually doing this consistently isn't easy, as testing isn't always a popular task. Assigning a dedicated person to write test code would involve a high learning cost and some interpersonal issues. So during development, I decided to have each person responsible for testing their own code. I would then review all the code in the end.

## Summary

The noteworthy parts about `Seed` itself have been discussed. Now, let's talk about other things.

### Self-Reflection

I learned a lot during the internship, but problems remain.

As a project manager, I was pretty terrible. There were significant shortcomings in controlling progress, allocating personnel, and handling other details.

For example:
- Lack of knowledge about frontend technologies likely means only the API server will be functional by the project's end.
- Only half of the project team members were truly engaged.
- Training for those who did participate felt hollow and lacked patience.

Clearly, I need further development. However, serving as both project manager and developer led me to ponder another issue.

### Discussion on Two Types of Abilities for SEers

**The ability to architect and oversee an entire system** and **the ability to choose, tailor, and use algorithms to implement a single function.**

The classroom education in our university's software school seems to focus only on the latter. This isn't particularly strange, as mastery of algorithms is easily measurable. One could say differences in ability are显著, much like solving math problems—people's creativity is very easy to evaluate under strict preconditions and constraints. However, the ability to reasonably set these so-called "strict preconditions and constraints," while important, is difficult to measure.

As for why this is self-contradictory, here's a simple, understandable, though perhaps not entirely apt, example: Everyone knows it's幼稚 and unrealistic for parents to strictly forbid their children from puppy love for fear it will耽误 studies, yet expect them to immediately start a family after graduation. Implicitly expecting students to become all-round talents after graduation **solely** based on good academic performance is also a slightly扭曲 notion. The difference lies in the latter contradiction being less尖锐 than the former.

I believe such internships are indeed a compensation for the shortcomings of classroom education. They offer an opportunity to avoid the contradiction between **grades** as a cultivation method and **capability** as the cultivation goal—the things these two symbols represent.
