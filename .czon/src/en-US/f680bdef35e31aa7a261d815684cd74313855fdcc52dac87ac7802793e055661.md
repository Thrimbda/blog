"summary": "This article describes how the delayed nature of sorrow haunts Bryan with memories of the past. Sorrow is depicted as a warm fluid sloshing in his chest, corroding his heart. Memories act like spooky action at a distance, manipulating his emotions and causing him to lose his sense of time, unable to distinguish between past and present. The essay references Keats' 'Ode on Melancholy' to further explore the coexistence of melancholy and beauty. Ultimately, Bryan becomes aware of the bleakness of human nature, yet remains unable to escape his role as a sacrificial offering in this spiraling tragedy."

Bryan never imagined that sorrow could also have a delayed effect—the ghosts of the past have come for him again, and this time, he no longer has the strength to resist.

If asked to describe the shape of **sorrow** now, he would say it’s like a fluid, held within his chest, sloshing as he walks, spilling out bit by bit to corrode his heart. When he lies down, it flows steadily, trembling only with each heartbeat.

As for its temperature, it’s certainly not cold—it’s warm, slightly warmer than the temperature of his chest, continuously releasing heat to slowly roast his heart. The sensation is like... a gentle simmer, stewing together with pain, yet never fully cooked. His active nerves persistently remind him of the taste of **pain**.

There is only one kind of spooky action at a distance in this world—the **memories** that stir this cauldron of abyssal soup from the back of his head. After fermenting for over a year alongside a fate as fragile as raindrops on duckweed, the moment he opened the cellar door filled with discarded memories, the brewed ghosts surged forth with the warm, sweet scent of pleasure and resentment, hitting him like a heavy hammer. The manifestation of this, in my view, was truly shameful—or, to put it plainly, shameful to the point of utter humiliation. I had never seen him like this before. Once sincere, confident, and youthful, now lost in the flow of time, he can no longer distinguish between what happened now, what happened two years ago, and what he thought happened yesterday but actually transpired a year ago. These **memories**, which he believed he had long lost over the past year, have ultimately dispersed in such a vividly visible form among all other orderly memories, infecting them like cancer. Even earlier, cleaner memories have now taken on sharp edges, wandering in his mind.

Unfortunately, poor Bryan is merely a pitiful one-dimensional temporal being, unaware that his mind, at certain moments, serves only as a medium for transmitting distant information to his countless iterations later, all while committing foolish acts of confidence tinged with faint sorrow. At this moment, he finally realizes the **bleakness** of human nature, caught between gods and beasts, yet remains uncontrollably destined to be a sacrificial offering in this spiraling tragedy.

Ode on Melancholy

BY JOHN KEATS


No, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist
       Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;
Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd
       By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine;
               Make not your rosary of yew-berries,
       Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be
               Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl
A partner in your sorrow's mysteries;
       For shade to shade will come too drowsily,
               And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.

But when the melancholy fit shall fall
       Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,
That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,
       And hides the green hill in an April shroud;
Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,
       Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,
               Or on the wealth of globed peonies;
Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,
       Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,
               And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.

She dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die;
       And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips
Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,
       Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:
Ay, in the very temple of Delight
       Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine,
               Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue
       Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;
His soul shalt taste the sadness of her might,
               And be among her cloudy trophies hung.

At this moment, he is filled with desolation, poor Bryan.
