"title": "Some Thoughts on Structure"
"summary": "This article starts from the concept of personal momentum, exploring how systems (such as companies, nations) are composed of the strong and the weak, with rules set by the strong or formed unconsciously by the masses. Humans, as collections of desires, interact within systems where strength and weakness can transform, and systems rise and fall. Using the example of a worker in a large corporation, the author analyzes how system rules affect the fulfillment of desires. Ultimately, it suggests that individuals should understand system rules, choose interactions that favor desire fulfillment, and potentially reshape or create new systems."

Here are the clues I have gathered so far:

-   I have come to realize that everyone has their own strengths; others are not fools.
-   Therefore, when a person exhausts their mental effort to accomplish something, they often gain something from it. This could be called a person's momentum.
-   When a group of people operates under a system's rules, although various internal frictions may arise—such as two individuals striving in opposite directions, or communication and collaboration between people becoming problematic—the momentum of each individual aggregates to form the total momentum of that system.
-   So, how are a system's rules established? I can think of two ways: top-down or bottom-up. That is, the will of the masses and the will of the elite. This likely holds true in any organization: a family, a school class, a company, or even a nation.
-   How do the elite and the masses within a system emerge? I believe this stems from the fundamental inequality between people, which in this framework can be considered a self-evident axiom. Consider an extreme example: the international society composed of the world's nations is a truly anarchic society because there is no true governing body to manage interactions between states. Yet, we still observe that nations have distinctions of strength and weakness. Within this anarchic societal framework, their relative strengths evolve and shift according to certain fundamental patterns. Delving deeper, endless explanations exist: the development and transformation of human social systems, cultural development determined by geography, similarities and differences between cultures, the evolution of economic laws. But ultimately, from the highest level of abstraction, the observable phenomenon is that there is always a distinction between the strong and the weak. The strong set the rules, and the weak survive under those rules. There is also mutual transformation between the strong and the weak. Thus, we call the strong the elite and the weak the masses. The number of the strong is far smaller than that of the weak, and the strong extract benefits from the weak.
-   The international society formed by nations is a system. A system formed by elementary school students is also a system. Larger systems can contain smaller ones. There are distinctions of strength even among the strong and among the weak. The absolute strong design systems for the weak, within which the relatively weak also have their own hierarchies and interactions. The relatively weak, living within a system, often perceive that system as their entire world, unaware they are surviving within a system designed by others. Or, even if aware, they feel powerless to change it.
-   People (the strong among them) actively construct systems, and people also unconsciously form systems. However, the interaction between people and systems is not one-sided; systems, in turn, influence people. When entering this absurd game, people have an initial position and state, constituting various additional inequalities beyond physiological inequality. These layered inequalities together form a person's overall inequality.
-   But people have momentum; they are subjectively active. In the process of interaction between people and between people and systems, the relative strength between individuals can transform, and systems also rise, decline, and change. This manifests as a game gaining popularity, with everyone starting to play, or a game reaching its end and being abandoned by people.
-   A person's momentum stems from their inner desires, released through their position and state within a system (intellectual level, era, country, family, influences from other people and systems encountered). Within this framework, the existence of inner desires in humans is also a self-evident axiom—the essence of human nature, difficult to summarize precisely but broadly meaning people strive with all their might to pursue immediate and long-term happiness and satisfaction.
-   A person is a collection of desires. Desires themselves are divided into long-term and short-term. Some desires may conflict with or diminish others. For example, a person may want to lose weight and get fit but also desires to eat delicious food in the moment—these are somewhat contradictory. Under different systems, a person will have some desires suitable for interaction within that system and others unsuitable. Our usual judgments about whether desires are "good" or "bad" are often based on a particular system's worldview. However, outside of any system, desires cannot be labeled as good/bad or high/low.
-   But a person's time and energy are limited. At any given time, only a small subset of desires can be satisfied. For an individual, this is an operational research challenge.
-   Thus, we have depicted a dynamic worldview. Expanding upon it, we can apply perspectives from the theory of contradictions for further explanation.
-   Considering that I am employed, many annoying things follow one after another. This is especially evident in so-called "large corporations" (big tech companies). A large corporation is also a system with many roles interacting under its rules. From the system's perspective:
    -   Workers work hard, strive to complete tasks, hoping for better performance to get promotions and raises. Here, the system sets rules dictating how workers should achieve their desires. Thus, momentum aggregates to form the system's total momentum, enabling the large corporation to interact within the system composed of such corporations.
    -   Workers are the weak within this system. The system also has bosses and senior leaders as the strong. The weak hope to become strong, while the strong hope to remain strong and continuously extract benefits from the weak.
    -   So, who sets the rules? This stems from the unconscious actions of workers (the weak) and the conscious actions of bosses and senior leaders (the strong). The unconscious actions of workers and the conscious actions of bosses can be understood as outlets for venting the anomalous total momentum (akin to a reduction of the normal total momentum, similar to an individual's "lower" desires) that aggregates under the system's rules. For example, bosses may wish for workers to infinitely sell their physical and intellectual labor, exerting themselves to provide momentum for the system (the company). Workers may not withstand this, leading to movements against 996 work culture. Consequently, bosses might realize that perhaps disallowing overtime is a better rule.
    -   Workers rarely realize that the rules of this system may not effectively satisfy their desires. Ultimately, desires are often artificially created.
    -   And a company is just one among countless systems. Interactions within this system might not benefit interactions in other systems (like society or family), although bosses tend to make you believe a different story.
-   Therefore, as individuals, we have an obligation to be responsible for our own well-being. We must carefully and prudently choose the systems we interact with, the games we want to play. Simultaneously, we must recognize that some systems and games are imposed upon us. For such systems, we should understand their rules, the meaning behind those rules, and the connection between the system and ourselves. So, as a worker, my purpose in choosing to work at a large corporation is:
    -   To have enough money to interact better within society, a mandatory system.
    -   To hone my skills to interact better within broader, longer-lifecycle systems like the industry or society.
    -   Recognition from peers I respect.
    -   The joy of solving problems.
    -   An ultimate goal: through my efforts, to reshape these systems to some extent according to my desires, or even to create entirely new systems.
-   Ultimately, we want the ability and freedom to satisfy as many of our desires as possible under the rules of these imposed systemic frameworks.
-   Therefore, I need to start from my own needs, understand the rules of systems imposed upon us, understand the rules of systems we are interested in, and judge to what extent interacting with these systems will satisfy our desires.
