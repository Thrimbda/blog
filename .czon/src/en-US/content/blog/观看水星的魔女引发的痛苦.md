"title": "The Pain Induced by Watching The Witch from Mercury"
"summary": "This article is the author's in-depth reflection after watching the fifth episode of the second season of the anime *The Witch from Mercury*. Using the protagonist Suletta's emotional journey as a thread, it details the intense pain evoked by the viewing experience and delves into the roots of this pain: stemming both from empathy for Suletta's existential crisis and her emotional turn from sweetness to humiliation, and from the author's own similar experiences facing real-world setbacks after resigning to start a business. The author draws analogies by citing poetry and *Love in the Time of Cholera* to explore the relationship between pain, growth, hope, and fear. The article ultimately concludes that, like Suletta, plunging into reality may lead to a bloody head, but one can also draw nourishment from it, and life is not a limited series of episodes, so there's no need to rush to a conclusion."

This article is a reflection on Suletta's emotional journey in *The Witch from Mercury*. Full spoilers ahead (even for *Love in the Time of Cholera*).

Although I also believe the progressive nature of *The Witch from Mercury* stems from its depiction of a world where a right-leaning capitalist society has developed to an extreme, its conflicts are thought-provoking, and even the seemingly absurd school sections are filled with satirical education for the audience; but that's not today's topic.

## Describing the Pain

It was so painful. That was my strongest feeling after watching S2 ep5.
It felt like being caught in a data storm, like something was about to shatter.

It's half an hour later now, 1:15 AM.
I'm holding my head, hands rubbing through my messy hair. My eyes are wide open, aimlessly staring at the pattern on the mousepad, forcing myself to take a breath now and then to avoid feeling suffocated. I've been spacing out like this for over half an hour.
It's not a dull ache, not "Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine," but pure pain, causing the dam of emotions in my heart to burst, releasing my own inner pain along with it.
I want to cry out loud, but not a single tear comes to help me release this emotion. So it scorches me, reverberating within this body, creating wave after wave of more painful aftershocks.

As for the reason for the pain?
— *The Witch from Mercury* itself is emotionally impactful enough. Coming to my senses, I searched online, trying to grasp something, but people online are always joking, explaining it as "slaughtering the yuri fans."
— Is it my own emotions, the experiences of this past year?
My mind is weak, my thoughts sluggish. This pain still courses through my heart. Do I even have a heart?
But if I don't think this through a bit tonight, I probably won't sleep. Then, severely sleep-deprived, a more vicious demon will be unleashed by the next afternoon: I'll lose the ability to work as dusk approaches, lose the will to sleep, lament another day gone, despair at the fading sense of meaning again, and then waste more time—time that could have been used for something at least slightly better than the above.

I am deeply aware of the impermanence of worldly affairs; I know the buildings of this city are too dark, so emotional projections dissipate into that darkness; I know the sense of powerlessness caused by my own weariness and laziness; I know everyone in this world must grasp something to construct their daily lives, and these daily lives are built around their own traumas—just as I am now desperately trying to grasp this article, to keep these words from abandoning me.

So, forcing my emotions to settle, I struggled from being a puddle of mud瘫在床上 back to sitting in front of the computer. I don't want to become Lady Melancholy's trophy to be hung up, at least not while I'm young.

Writing this far, aside from a small lump of charcoal-like substance in my chest still scorching, the situation is much better.

## Examining the Pain

Let's use the reflection on *The Witch from Mercury* as a线索.

From S1 ep11 onwards, the protagonist Suletta experiences an existential crisis: she begins to move from a state of "being-in-itself" towards "being-for-itself"—from initially just wanting to act normal (completing a wish list), to later becoming human because she gradually built connections and had people she cared about.

Because she has people she cares about, she is no longer "in-itself," no longer in a carefree state. Suletta, pure as a blank sheet, begins to be shaped.

Because she has people she cares about, she must offer her heart to them. This heart is pure, yet also fragile and sensitive.

And so, discovering that she似乎 misunderstood, that the reality seems to be that she isn't needed or cared for by anyone, that no one noticed she was hungry even without getting a lunchbox, fear takes over. So she hides alone in a bathroom stall and cries.
At this point, Suletta detests this pain. How we wish to retract the things that cause pain when we are in pain! But since the pain is already here, can悔棋 solve the problem? No. Not even destroying the world can solve it.

Here, I want to digress,抓住 this wisp of inspiration to剖析 this night-like pain. Like the end of *Love in the Time of Cholera* where the bachelor finally pursues his beloved after fifty years, since I first read it four or five years ago, I still emotionally consider this the cruelest thing—the美好的青春 is already gone, the沧桑的心灵 is riddled with holes, and the one now bathing in the sunset on the ship is no longer the romantic youth in love who communicated through letters.
That youth died, died in Fermina's一次又一次冷酷的拒绝, died in空虚的幽会 with one lover after another, died in the遗憾 of the黑女孩's misplaced time. I too once held my head and wept for this, mourning that lost time, mourning that dead youth. To this day, I can still hear my own sobs from another summer night after finishing this book alone.
Only now I understand, this is the哀鸣 of the dead youth, not the哀鸣 of the bachelor over seventy. Perhaps my偏执 prevented me from seeing what the author clearly wrote: the bachelor is bathing in the sunset with a sense of圆满的爱意.
It was only because I was too young then, too young to follow the thread of time even within the book, to understand the bachelor's fifty-three years, seven months, and eleven days of日拱一卒.
Thinking of this, I have clarity. This part of the pain can be定性: What if the youth's future is not an Odyssean heroic journey, but a gradual withering and颓唐 like linking the fire in Dark Souls? This is the pain born from fear of the unknown.
But the future never reveals its form. Whether it's Odyssey or Dark Souls remains unknown. So the youth moves forward cautiously, in the light of hope, under the shadow of fear.

And Suletta encountered her first existential crisis, so she instinctively wanted to return to the母体 state, to confide in her mother.

Until the crux of Suletta's issue—the person she cares about—comes to rescue her, tells her that she needs Suletta, and imperiously demands that she "always stay by my side," "don't lose any duels," "add more soil to the tomatoes," "clean the room twice a week," "send three messages every day." Only then is that柔软的少年心 released from pain, carefully呵护,而不是被肆意践踏个稀碎.

As a viewer, I felt强烈的共情 at this point because I've had such moments too—being rejected, being needed. Simple, decisive resolutions are always爽快, and this time it was真心换真心, it was truly, genuinely so sweet.

But Lady Melancholy always arrives unannounced.

> In the very temple of delight, veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine.

The youth终究还是渐行渐远, because the youth doesn't understand why fairy tales always end with "happily ever after," while life never stops.
At this sweetest point, I began to worry for Suletta.炽热的爱恋 will cool down,甜蜜的烦恼 might eventually leave only烦恼. And Suletta only has甜蜜, no烦恼. She can't even be independent, can't leave her mother or Aerial or the person she cares about. She hasn't yet become a true human individual.

Therefore, at the end of S2 ep5, it's all returned in kind. One must endure pain equal to this sweetness to bear its weight.
Being told she was used, having her校服 representing honor stripped away, being labeled as the乡下女孩 from Mercury—being humiliated, humiliated by reality, humiliated by the person she thought could shelter her heart,绝望地嘶号, unable to lift her head.

Even understanding from a god's-eye view that the purpose of this is to sever the umbilical cord of the overgrown infant Suletta, this pain依然以大剂量投射到我身上, to the point that even as I write this, I can't stop trembling, unable to type properly.

Why is it so intense?

Choosing to进取, one is bound to get a bloody nose. Although Suletta was well-protected,天真到了变态的地步, although she never thought about the meaning of piloting a Gundam, just as she never considered the consequences her choices might lead to, she still颤巍巍选择进取 within her own small格局.

Perhaps the emotional projection comes from here. A year ago, when I chose to resign from a big tech company and start a business, I also couldn't foresee the翻天覆地的变化 in life this year would bring: starting to feel the loss of security from a salary in the second month after leaving, the sense of defeat from quick initial success in创业 followed by even quicker failure, and the ensuing personal financial crisis; I started feeling不好意思跟奶奶打电话了, then艰难地拾起失败 from that wave of failure,总结教训, began slowly夯实基础, trying to make everything better.
Before starting, I always thought创业 must be轰轰烈烈 every moment, that people would be无限亢奋 like they were on adrenaline, and I thought I was prepared to face any困难. But I also never imagined what kind of重击 "any困难" would deliver across all aspects of human life.

归根结底, I rarely pondered my own situation in detail, and was even mocked by someone I cared about for my "不切实际的乐观," because I still felt that things not yet concluded cannot be judged. But I couldn't免了 possibly咀嚼 these失落 in the depths of my subconscious in dreams,以至于在看到斯莱塔重重跌倒后破大防 in this episode, and then拽出这么些文字 from my mind.

Like Suletta, I plunged into the soil of reality with my变态的天真 and immediately began getting pruned and cut by reality's scissors,头破血流; like Suletta, I plunged into the泥土 of reality, and though头破血流, there is肥沃的养分 in the泥土 to absorb; like Suletta, I also have people who呵护 me. Unlike Suletta, my life is not a 24-episode TV drama that must end happily ever after or in death within 24 episodes.
