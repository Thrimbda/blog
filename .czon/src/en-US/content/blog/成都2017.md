During that pleasant and intoxicating seven-day trip to Chengdu in the summer three years ago, I probably never imagined I would return to this city in less than four years.

With what kind of mood, carrying what kind of burdens, and intending to pursue what kind of aspirations.

<!--more-->

I had heard as early as the freshman orientation that the Software School had a junior-year internship program, which would take place in Kunshan or Chengdu. Time flew, and soon during the winter break of my junior year, I received the news that we were coming to Chengdu.

My study plans for the winter break were never properly implemented. By now, I had only finished reading *The Mythical Man-Month*. Most of my productive work time was spent on that annoying personal project, which still isn't completely finished. I guess I fell into the so-called "tar pit." But then again, the time wasn't entirely wasted. Working on a project is better than playing games and then regretting it—that's what I think.

## The Trip to Chengdu

Speaking of Chengdu, to an outsider like me, it's a holy land for foodies, a city of leisure, the Land of Abundance. But I'm not a foodie, so in that sense, Chengdu holds little appeal for me. However, I had promised a classmate during the summer after high school graduation that we would travel together—doing a good deed, you could say—so we went together. After checking flight prices back then, we found tickets to Chongqing were very cheap, so we decided to play in Chongqing for two days first, then take a high-speed train to Chengdu. Eating and drinking along the way, it felt no different from what I had imagined. I did get a real glimpse of the laid-back lifestyle of Chengdu locals. Sometimes, seeing old Chengdu residents strolling leisurely on the streets made my own mood relax, but unfortunately, I was distracted back then, always thinking about other things, so that trip didn't feel real.

So now, there's no sense of novelty left. I haven't attached any unrealistic expectations to this internship privately. My only hope is that I can calm my mind and focus.

Apart from almost going to the wrong train station (a place called Xi'an South Station that I had never been to), the journey went smoothly overall. Our group of six arrived in this easygoing city just like that.

Our destination was northwest of Chengdu, in the suburbs of Pi County. I was told it would take two hours by car, and I fully expected it to be some desolate place. We got off the train around six in the evening. At the station, an uncle followed us from the moment we exited, trying to get his first fare of the day. We were so annoyed that we granted his wish—25 yuan per person for the six of us to get to our stop, which seemed reasonable.

**And thus, I witnessed the prowess of Chengdu drivers.**

Dozens of traffic lights, and the driver uncle, taking advantage of the still-dark sky, didn't stop at a single one. A seven-seater van, cruising at 80 km/h the whole way without a hint of fear—even wilder than Xi'an's taxi drivers.

Upon arrival, I found it much prettier than I had imagined. It didn't feel like a county town at all, more like a big city with towering buildings.

### About Jingrong Town

After living here for a few days, I find this place strange, with an eerie feeling—so few people, yet everywhere is filled with motivational slogans encouraging entrepreneurship: giant banners with photos of Ma Yun, Lei Jun, Robin Li, even Steve Jobs and Bill Gates hanging on roadside high-rises. There are even three coffee shops in one block. It all feels so earnest.

So, filled with curiosity, I searched on Zhihu and found these results:

- [Jingrong Town, Chengdu's first startup-themed town. Will it become the new Zhongguancun?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/38584390)
- [How do you evaluate the current state and future trends of Chengdu's internet industry?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/38545586)

In summary, it's a modern town built in response to the national "mass entrepreneurship" call, rising from the leftover real estate of Foxconn. Currently in its early development stage, the government has set up the infrastructure and then offers quite good benefits to attract investment and businesses, aiming to develop it into an incubation base for startup talent/companies. This is related to the new development policies of Chengdu's new mayor, with the ultimate goal of becoming the next Zhongguancun, or even the next Silicon Valley.

But I also think entrepreneurship requires both an environment and a methodology; you can't just rely on hype. What this place will become in the future remains to be seen.

## New Semester, "New Atmosphere"

I thought coming here would mean an excellent internet speed, a comfortable environment, and a personal workstation for everyone. Who knew we'd still have to attend classes, with no internet in the dorm and terrible speeds in the classroom.

In such an environment, I perfectly missed the registration for retaking Probability Theory and for the Software Project Management course :) (just by one hour).

As for why I have one retake and one make-up exam: the former is because I slacked off and didn't study seriously for a deferred exam, leading to a fail and losing the chance to skip the exam; the latter is because I missed too many classes and was barred from taking the exam. But looking on the bright side, my university experience is now complete :)

Ultimately, it's because my mind is always wandering, never paying attention to my own affairs. So, suffering losses is pretty much routine for me.

Missing registration nowadays, with increasingly strict school management, probably means I'll see those courses next semester.

Anyway, live and learn.

## Back to the Main Topic

The main purpose of this trip to Chengdu is to do the internship, aiming to learn some practical knowledge and develop software following standard,规范ized processes.

Having had that not-so-successful experience with freelance work before, I came here with open ears this time, genuinely wanting to learn something humbly.

But according to the requirements, we can only do Java development. This means I can't continue with the previous [Orange-Juice](https://github.com/function-x/Orange-Juice) project I was working on with a classmate, so we had to regroup. My roommates were insistent that I stay with them, so I'll suppress that bit of regret—after all, what does it matter what I work on? The important thing is to be serious.

So—clear away distracting thoughts. The mistakes made are in the past. It's time to settle down and focus for this month.

I heard it snowed again in Xi'an. Here in Chengdu, it rained. The air is damp, carrying a hint of chill.

I hope I can walk forward quietly, one step at a time.
