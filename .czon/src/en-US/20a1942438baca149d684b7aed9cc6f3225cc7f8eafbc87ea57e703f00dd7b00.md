"title": "2026 Work Log: AI Assistance and Efficiency Improvement"
"summary": "This is a work log from January 22, 2026. The author reviews the day's work, which includes refactoring a notification tool, coding using a multi-agent mode, handling server security issues, and managing daily affairs. In the reflection section, the author contemplates the personal upper limit for simultaneously handling tasks and proposes two core improvement directions: first, optimizing the autonomy of AI Agents to make them less intrusive, more productive, and more reliable; second, enhancing personal mental energy management and multitasking capabilities. Based on this, the author plans to attempt designing a multi-agent template the next day and continue exploring methods for managing mental energy and context. The core theme of the article is leveraging AI technology to scale personal capabilities and then attempting to scale others."

# 2026
## 2026-01 January
### 2026-01-22
**What I did today:**
1.  Refactored the `opencode-feishu-notifier`. It now sends notifications to users in a predetermined manner.
2.  Continued having AI work on `legionmind-github-bridge`. I started using opencode's multi-agent mode. It launched 5 agents to modify 5 issues, and it ran silently for two hours, completely consuming my 5-hour quota of codex tokens.
3.  A node in the sg cluster died today. I checked the logs and found it was under constant SSH brute-force attack attempts, which is not good. Briefly considered several possible actions:
    *   Disable password authentication.
    *   Disable the SSH daemon's exposure to the entire internet.
    *   Move the cluster behind NAT.
4.  Handled some miscellaneous tasks. ZL is coming to Suzhou next week, spent some time making arrangements.

**What I'm thinking:**

At this stage, I can only manage 2-3 things simultaneously. This includes development work, daily scheduling, thinking, and output. Beyond this range, I become overwhelmed and easily fatigued. This is even while I'm already trying to delegate as much work as possible to AI Agents. Therefore, I believe there should be two improvement directions:
*   For coding tasks, I should maximize the autonomy of the agents. Optimization goals include:
    1.  Minimize interruptions to me.
    2.  Maximize their productive work.
    3.  Improve the reliability of their work as much as possible.
*   I also need some personal improvement:
    1.  Manage my mental energy better to avoid rapid fatigue.
    2.  Enhance my ability to work simultaneously across different contexts without dropping things, forgetting, and to manage progress.

Based on the above thoughts, I think I can try two directions tomorrow:
1.  Design a multi-agent template for legionmind and experiment with it on a coding task for `yuan` using opencode.
2.  Continue keeping this work log to explore methods for managing mental energy and context.

**What I plan to do tomorrow?**
1.  As mentioned above, run an experiment with a multi-agent setup.
2.  Continue working on `legionmind-github-bridge`.
3.  If time permits, work on cluster security.

Overall, my current main focus is using AI to scale myself up, and then attempt to scale others.
