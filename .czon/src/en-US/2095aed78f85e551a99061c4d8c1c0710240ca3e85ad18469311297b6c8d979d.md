"summary": "This document details the usage of the /admin feature, designed to help users edit content/**.md files without introducing a self-hosted backend. It leverages GitHub OAuth authorization, automatically saves drafts to local IndexedDB, and writes Markdown and images back to the GitHub repository upon publishing (by default, creating a branch and PR). The guide includes configuration steps (e.g., copying config files, creating a GitHub OAuth App) and usage workflows (e.g., connecting and authorizing, editing content, inserting images, publishing a PR), suitable for users looking to streamline their content management process."

# /admin Usage Guide (MVP)

## Goal

Without introducing a self-hosted backend:

- Edit any `content/**.md` file
- Automatically save drafts locally (IndexedDB)
- Write Markdown and images back to the GitHub repository upon publishing (default: create a branch + PR)

## Configuration

1. Copy `static/admin/config.example.js` to `static/admin/config.js`
2. Create a GitHub OAuth App and fill in the `oauthClientId`
   - Homepage URL: `https://0xc1.space/`
   - Callback URL: `https://0xc1.space/admin/` (not used for device flow, but required by the GitHub form)

> `config.js` should not contain any secrets; only the `client_id` is needed here.
>
> If you want **the published site to also be able to use `/admin/` directly**, commit `static/admin/config.js` to the repository (it contains no secrets, so it's safe to make public).

## Usage

1. Open `/admin/`
2. Click "Connect (Device Flow)"
3. Follow the on-page instructions to enter the code on GitHub and complete authorization
4. Refresh the file list to load `content/**.md` files
5. Edit content (drafts are automatically saved locally)
6. Insert images (they will be written to `static/images/uploads/...` upon publishing)
7. Click "Publish (PR)" to create a PR; merging it will trigger the site publishing workflow
