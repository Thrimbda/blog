In 2016, during my sophomore to junior year, my monthly living allowance was 1000 yuan. My girlfriend at the time had 1200 yuan per month.

Her school was in the far southwest of Chang'an District, mine was in Shapo Village. We met every week.

There was a Holiland bakery outside the southeast gate of our school. She was from another school. When she came to visit me on weekends, she said the half-baked cheesecake was delicious, costing 8 yuan each. We could only afford to buy the two-pack. After buying it, we had to cross the street to take the bus. On the overpass, we would eat it bite by bite, sharing it.

Later, in the second semester of my senior year, I found an internship paying 30 yuan per hour. With overtime and bonuses, my monthly income reached over ten thousand yuan. I had never had control over so much money before.

On May Day 2018, I went alone to the bakery at the school gate and bought a box of five. I went across the street and took the same bus, eating it all by myself in silence.

Her graduate school was in Zhongguancun, my internship was in Wudaokou. We never saw each other again.

The most homesick episode yet. 😭

Suddenly craved watermelon, so I bought one online. It reminded me that every summer since childhood, my family had watermelon every day. When I was little, my parents would cut it up for me to munch on. Now when I go home, if I get a craving at night, I sneak half a watermelon from the fridge and cut it up.

Anyway, being at home feels safe, like having a protective shield.

Just cut up the watermelon and ate it. It's sweeter than every watermelon my parents bought this year, but I miss home so much. 😭

Traveling with ZL (Part Four) - Reunion After a Long Time

When over seven hundred days and nights of oppressive time had crawled by on the calendar, and a glimmer of light finally shone through my work life, I decided to end this long self-exile. I planned to cross the ocean at the end of September to visit ZL, whom I hadn't seen for a full three years.

I don't know when it started, but the starting point of my travels always seems to be after the journey has begun. That is to say, there's no anticipation lasting one or two weeks before departure, no lying in bed at night imagining the wonderful things that will happen on this trip. It's just packing and leaving, and I was still solving work problems right before departure. This makes the whole process too rational and lacking in emotion. This continued until I asked for a small bottle of wine on the plane. The warmth rising from my chest after drinking it dispelled this excess rationality. Only then did my anticipation for the unknown and my nervousness about reuniting with a long-unseen old friend begin to dance in my mind.

After getting off the plane and out of the station, I spotted him. He had cut his hair short and was no longer skinny. Now he was a burly guy with just the right hair length. Seeing each other, we couldn't suppress our rising smiles as we gradually approached. The old flame was rekindled. The outdoor air was a bit crisp, and we ducked into his little car.
Soon, after the joy of reunion subsided, I noticed he seemed to have armored himself with a transparent shell, whether from not seeing each other for too long or as a necessity of life in North America. This shell kept me and all the unknowns of the world at bay. What was presented to the world was an emotionally stable, burly man, but in certain moments, you could glimpse the awkward youth beneath that shell.
Fortunately, it was an unstable shell. In ZL's little car, the scenery along the way quickly crushed the shell under the influence of time. Within 36 hours, we were once again chatting and joking like in those years in Suzhou, and shamelessly commenting on every girl who walked past us—except for Asian faces.

Among my many dreams of dissolving into the river and being forgotten by the world, one was to drive on the PCH while listening to Jaden's song "PCH." Before reaching Monterey, I mentioned this to ZL. Without a word, he found the song and put it on repeat. Under the clear sunlight, by the misty, azure sea, as the intro to "PCH" spilled out, the sea breeze took shape. We chased the constantly collapsing horizon, the rolling wheels continuously grinding out new memories to patch over my lost dreams.

Sometimes the sunset was ahead of us. Fatigued by jet lag, I stared at the evening glow in silence while ZL, who was driving, was also silent. Twilight and lights fell on our faces. Under the gaze of the twilight gods, we drove towards the immortal sun, and within this silence was an uninterrupted conversation. Then he broke the silence: "Tsk, need to find a song suitable for this moment," ZL said while fiddling with the main control screen.

- P1: ZL has many strange little gadgets. After entering his house, I found a small round sunglasses;
- P3: I brought the bottle of ice wine ZL gave me, which had been with me for five years, to the US and opened it with ZL to drink;
- P7: ZL said he really likes this photo, but it makes me look fat, which I don't really like;
- P9: Two weeks later, I stayed at ZL's place again for a night when transiting through San Francisco on my way home.

Traveling with ZL (Part Three) - Want to Go Cycling Around Qinghai Lake?

In the summer of 2021, a few weeks before ZL went abroad to study, we agreed to go cycling around Qinghai Lake. The trip was six days and five nights, with the actual cycling around the lake taking a full four days: a total of 360 km, averaging 90 km per day. Even a week after returning, with my diet back to normal, I still lost 5 kg.

I had wanted to do another crazy travel plan like this ever since implementing one during the summer before starting university in 2014. Over the years, I had urged and called upon every friend around me. ZL was the only one who showed great interest and responded positively.

We set off from a bike rental shop in Haiyan County (I brought my own bike, ZL rented a touring bike) and cycled clockwise around the lake.

The sky and water merged into one line, under a clear sky stretching for miles. Looking out, there was only the road extending to the horizon. Under the vast blue sky was an even bluer sea, beside which were large fields of rapeseed, and on the road beside the fields, there were only the two of us.
For four days, the world was compressed into the rhythmic pedaling left and right. Between heaven and earth, there were only the two of us, our tired bodies supporting infinitely energetic minds. We didn't even bother listening to music; our conversations were hard to end.

Qinghai Lake has been expanding for seven years. A statue that stood by the shore in 2014 was half submerged in water by 2021. I wondered if, in my lifetime, Qinghai Lake would reconnect with rivers and gradually become a freshwater lake. Would we come back then? Not daring to hope for another cycling trip, but at least to drink a large pot of milk tea in a tent. And then brag about how interesting it was.

Only the severe migraine from altitude sickness that lasted almost half the journey, a few continuous 30 km uphill climbs, occasional heavy rain, poor accommodation conditions, and the particular awkwardness of a 24-25-year-old artsy youth could add a little bitterness to this trip.

It's worth mentioning that the cycling on the last day was accompanied by continuous heavy rain and endless uphill climbs. Our 24 Snickers bars were down to the last 6, and we were almost sick of drinking Red Bull. In the afternoon, I vaguely felt a chill at the base of my tongue, realizing it was a bad sign. While resting about 20 km from the finish line, ZL's sense of humor was still going strong, leaving behind the masterpiece "c1 Peeing Picture." Fortunately, a Tibetan truck driver asked if we needed help. The moment I sat in the warm, dry, air-conditioned cab, I realized how cold I was. I shivered for another ten minutes on the road.

After returning to Xining, we fiercely ate two jin of hand-grabbed mutton. That was the last time I saw ZL before this autumn.

- Met a Hong Kong uncle with a flat tire. After helping him pump it up, he took this super cool photo for us.
- I retaliated by taking a picture of ZL peeing.
- The hand-grabbed mutton was incredibly delicious.

Traveling with ZL (Part Two) - Happy Days and Farewell

"Hey, ZL, we're on a business trip in Suzhou now. If we don't stay in hotels, the monthly business trip allowance can completely cover the rent. Then the leftover rent can be used to go all out on decorations!"

"Damn, you're right!"

(Unfortunately, the business trip allowance was canceled a month after saying this.)

Life in Suzhou was like university. We were in the High-speed Rail New Town in the far north of Suzhou, surrounded by nothing. Every night at nine, the streets were quiet everywhere, and it was hard to even see a person.
There were very few rental options near the company. Most people chose the same apartment building, a ten-minute walk from the company. This was the dormitory of "Momenta University."

ZL and I began trying to build a life. For example, I truly learned to cook. ZL also added quite a few things. Even the outbreak of the pandemic didn't affect this; instead, it brought us closer to other colleagues. That's also when we got to know @playground. Soon, we found ourselves often playing *Super Smash Bros.* together at @playground's place downstairs.

Therefore, my memories of the time at MMT always feel happy and warm.

ZL's girlfriend of four years was studying in Canada at the time (this was also an important reason for ZL to study abroad). Before the pandemic broke out, he went to reunite with his girlfriend and brought back a bottle of ice wine for me. In the subsequent five years, I moved a total of six times. That was one of the few things I always kept with me. At first, I just felt the timing wasn't right to open it. Later, it developed into a deliberate act. No matter where I was, it was always lying in my fridge.

In the autumn of 2021, ZL set off to study abroad.

- ZL said it's okay to post his photos casually.

Today, Zhengzheng said he's never had a traffic violation. I said, "Hehe, me neither."
Casually opened the traffic management app 12123 and my pupils dilated in shock. 😖

Thinking about it carefully, it's actually pretty impressive (lol).

Took advantage of no one being around to pluck a few little clusters of scarlet sage from the central flower bed to suck the nectar. When I came out, I awkwardly passed by a couple who had watched my sneaky behavior the whole time.

Yesterday, I drove out without my brain. The headlight shattered, resulting in a broken right face for the car and losing driving privileges for five days.

Today, I just want to slack off. I've been browsing the Crew for an hour. Browsing the Crew feels good.

Now I'm hungry and want to sneak out for McDonald's.

Tiefling Sorcerer Phil Cavendish had an unusual Midwinter.

Three months ago, one day, to cheer up his depressed mother, he packed his bags and set off for Waterdeep to find his wayward sister and persuade her to come home early—Alice Cavendish.

As an adopted child, Phil's early life as a street performer made him understand early on that some people just don't know how good they have it. They choose to leave a comfortable noble lady's life to go out and make their way in the world.

But it was also this willful sister's persistence that gave the orphan Phil, who had an uncertain future on the streets over a decade ago, a comfortable and warm home. Phil's feelings towards his sister were contradictory.

However, nearly a month of searching had almost exhausted Phil's patience. Thinking of this, anger towards his sister took over again. Even! Ahem. Even Alice chose to worship Sune. The more Phil thought about it, the angrier he got. Unconsciously triggering a Wild Magic Surge, the chaotic power in his bloodline caused him to teleport in a flash to the sister he was mentally scolding at that moment.

"Young man, although you helped heal my wound, as an elder who has sworn to eradicate evil and uphold good, I must express my opinion. Your attire seems rather inappropriate, especially in a place like the Red-Eyed Owl."

"What I wear is none of your business, you creepy old man! I kindly prayed to Lady Sune to heal you, and you start lecturing me! You know..."

When he found his sister, she was arguing with an aasimar old man named Allen. But that wasn't important anymore. Phil's sudden appearance startled them both. A girl in fine but ill-fitting clothes, who had been sneaking up on Alice, nearly stumbled and bumped into Phil. The two arguing didn't know who to look at.

"...Phil?" Alice looked at the embarrassed Phil in confusion.

"Hi! Ready to go home, my dear sister? Mom says she misses you." Phil tried to put on an awkward yet polite smile.

"Not now, Philip! Allen, I'll settle with
