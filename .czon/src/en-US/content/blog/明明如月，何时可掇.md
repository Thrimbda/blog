There are some things I want to write down.

A bean-sized drop of sweat fell to the ground. I noticed another drop land on the conveyor belt of the security scanner.

Because I had to get from BUPT (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications) to Beijing West Railway Station, check in, and board the train within half an hour: during the frantic dash, I only stopped to catch my breath while queuing, once again noticing the ground.

A year has passed.

Some questions, once they materialize from thoughts into language in the mind, already have their answers. This article was started a month ago, born from scattered musings. While eating, waiting for the bus, walking, or trying to sleep, whenever my mind wandered slightly, they would seize the chance to rush from all corners of the world into my head; but when I truly tried to grasp them, they would betray me, slip away, as if deliberately keeping their distance.

But regardless, after a whole year, there are always things I want to write.

## The Old Steed in the Stable

The two ends of this year—the beginning and the end—were both the **MSC Summer Camp**. Let's start from here.

Compared to last year, this time there was a distinct sense of loss. The reasons, aside from carrying mental baggage, were that I had reserved the space for preserving such precious memories for last year, holding back somewhat. Thinking this way, even I find it a bit sentimental—but it's true. So I didn't participate much in the discussions, except for one time when a chubby teammate's idea was so worthy of attack that I immediately spoke up against it.

On **Day 2**, everyone went to Nanluoguxiang. The familiar railings of the subway station no longer had Brother Yong leaning against them, and this bustling alley had lost its novelty for me. While changing the string of a bracelet in one of the small shops, I blood-sacrificed a bead—it flew onto the street when the shop owner cut the old string and was never found again. Beyond anger, I faintly felt this was actually fate.

So, I skipped the **Day 3** City Tour to find Xiao Dai. I figured a year wouldn't change a person's appearance much, so I recognized her at first glance as she rushed out energetically from the direction of the Intelligent Building to open the door. It was truly delightful! Visiting a friend without any baggage. I secretly resolved to remember the library of the Intelligent Building and those punk-style high-rises in Zhongguancun. Two days later, I added another obsession to these: I must eat the Yellow Peach Beef Tenderloin at BUPT one more time in this life.

## The Bitter Days Gone By

The brief journey to the capital has already ended.

I returned to my **balanced** but **unstable** life. Balanced because I am content within it and do not seek change. Unstable because underlying pressures make one attempt to change or become decadent. Long ago in Chinese class, when I learned the word "decadent," I didn't know it would become my great enemy.

To put it plainly, I am too good to myself, unable to bear making myself act decisively. I need some stimulation to move forward, to experience immense loss the moment a dream is shattered, and thus seek change.

> Forlorn! the very word is like a bell
>    To toll me back from thee to my sole self!

Just like the sense of loss Keats felt after watching the nightingale fly away until its song disappeared. Except my pressure doesn't come from a terminal illness; I am more youthful and hopeful than this ill-fated poet. But tell me, why am I becoming more and more decadent?

**Perhaps this is me going through the most difficult part of university.**

But who knows?

## How to Relieve Worry?

How to relieve worry? Cao Cao's answer seems quite ordinary to me. Drinking is always the easy choice; drowning sorrows in wine is something everyone can do. Waking up the next day brings nothing but a headache that makes one reflect on life. The answer to this question may be different for everyone. For me, it seems the root of all problems lies in the inability to calm the mind; neither anxiety nor carefree bliss are emotions a normal person should sustain. So we must all survive between these two extremes.

I thought of a movie I recently saw: *Bright Star* directly used a sonnet Keats gave to Fanny as its title, and the entire film tells the love story between Keats and Fanny in the three years before his death abroad. The whole movie is quiet and full of beauty, worth watching with a calm mind. What I want to talk about is Keats himself. After the movie's ending, text states: *Keats died at twenty five, believing himself a failure. Today he is recognized as one of the greatest Romantic Poets.* What I want to say is, think about Keats's experience. What made him? What caused his early death? Setting aside the possibility that he was a genius—which might not be a reason—**because we all believe that the times make the hero, and the hero makes the times.** People's worlds influence each other. Under what circumstances can a person write such poetry? I think perhaps only in England at that time, under such dire straits, could Keats become Keats. People then revered art—poetry certainly included—while life was extremely harsh. The poet could only break free from reality's shackles through thought, as said in *Ode to a Nightingale*:

> Away! away! for I will fly to thee,
>
> Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,
>
> But on the viewless wings of Poesy,

So how to relieve worry? What is worth pursuing?

The answer to this question isn't that simple, but from what we see and learn, we can still find some clues.

## Sing to Express My Aspiration

At the beginning of this article, I mentioned my trip to Beijing. Let's continue from there.

On the night of **Day 5**, Cutuy and I talked almost the whole night in the hotel, which was very enlightening. I mentioned before that the world is layered. What do we rely on to climb upward? What helps us climb faster? I've heard a saying and quite agree with it: *We can change, because we are educated.* Education brings a person knowledge and, through this knowledge, grants a broader **vision**. Through each person's vision, we summarize what we see into methodologies to establish ourselves in this world. But different perspectives lead to different conclusions. Thinking about it this way is quite interesting.

Later, I shamelessly went to BUPT again to mooch a meal off Xiao Dai, then desperately ran (rode) to the West Station to catch the train. Hence the scene at the beginning with sweat dripping to the ground. So I started writing on the train and have been writing for ten days until today. How fortunate, let me sing to express my aspiration.
