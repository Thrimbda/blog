After nearly a month of thinking and consideration, I’ve decided to adopt a new ID: **Thrimbda**.

What does it mean?

Alive and thrive.

The ending is taken from the English pronunciation of the Greek letter lambda, a symbol that represents “great wisdom appearing as foolishness.”

Thus,

**Thrimbda**!

I wasn’t satisfied with ending the post so briefly, so let me ramble a bit more.

## On Tao and Technique

To summarize, all knowledge in this world can be divided into two levels: **Tao** and **Technique**.

Tao is the overview;

It is the framework;

It is having a well-thought-out plan.

Technique, on the other hand, is the details;

It is the implementation;

It is the clever tricks and hacks.

As for me,

I cannot clearly see my own Tao,

Yet I have invested considerable effort in Technique.

How much of it has been in vain!
