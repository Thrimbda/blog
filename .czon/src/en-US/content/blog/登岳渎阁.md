# Ascending the Yuedu Pavilion

Peaks cluster like gatherings, waves surge like fury,
The road to Tongguan lies between mountains and rivers.

From the Yuedu Pavilion, the eight-hundred-li Qin Plain unfolds before one's eyes:

Behold—the crisscrossing paths, the sounds of chickens and dogs,
The favorable weather and prosperous land, a place blessed with outstanding people!

To the north, one gazes upon the grandeur of the Loess Plateau;
To the south, one faces the majestic Qinling Mountains and Mount Hua.
Nourished by the mighty, surging Wei River,
This land has fostered the splendid and profound civilization of China!

May we rise with the rooster's crow, carry forward the past, and open up the future!

With profound joy, I express my aspirations through song.
