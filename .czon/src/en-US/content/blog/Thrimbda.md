The author reflects on having focused too much on Technique while neglecting Tao, leading to fruitless efforts. The core of the article lies in using the change of personal ID to provoke philosophical reflection on the levels of life or knowledge, emphasizing the importance of Tao."

After thinking about and considering it for nearly a month, I've decided to use a new ID: **Thrimbda**.

What does it mean?

Alive and thrive.

The tail is taken from the English pronunciation of the Greek letter lambda (λ), a letter that represents great wisdom appearing as foolishness.

So,

**Thrimbda**!

I wasn't satisfied with the article being so short, so let me ramble a bit more.

## On Tao and Technique

To summarize, the knowledge in this world can essentially be divided into two levels: **Tao** and **Technique**.

Tao is the overview;
it is the framework;
it is having a well-thought-out plan.

Technique, on the other hand, is the detail;
it is the implementation;
it is the clever tricks and skills.

As for me,
I cannot clearly see my own Tao,
yet I have put considerable effort into Technique.

How much of it has been in vain!
