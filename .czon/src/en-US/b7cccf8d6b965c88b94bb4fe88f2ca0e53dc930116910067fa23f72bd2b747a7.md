# Requirements Management

First, an excerpt from a typical failure example in project management cited in *The Mythical Man-Month*.

<!--more-->

> **The Management Lesson of the Tower of Babel**
>
> According to Genesis, the Tower of Babel was humanity's second great engineering feat after Noah's Ark, but it was also the first complete engineering failure.
>
> This story is profoundly insightful and educational in many aspects and at different levels. Let's consider it purely as an engineering project and see what management lessons can be learned. How favorable were the project's initial conditions? Did they have:
>
> 1. A clear goal?
>
>    Yes, though naive and nearly impossible. Moreover, the project failed long before encountering this fundamental limitation.
>
> 2. Manpower?
>
>    Plenty.
>
> 3. Materials?
>
>    Abundant clay and tar asphalt in Mesopotamia.
>
> 4. Sufficient time?
>
>    Yes, there were no signs of any time constraints.
>
> 5. Adequate technology?
>
>    Yes, the pyramid or conical structure itself is stable and effectively disperses pressure loads. Masonry techniques had been deeply studied. Again, the project failed long before reaching any technological limits.
>
> So, given all these conditions, why did the project fail? What were they lacking? Two things—**communication**, and the result of communication—**organization**. They couldn't talk to each other, and thus couldn't cooperate. When cooperation broke down, work came to a halt. Reading between the lines of the historical account, we infer that the lack of communication led to arguments, frustration, and group suspicion. Soon, the tribes began to split—choosing isolation over quarreling with each other.

The author's analysis reveals that the reasons for this project's failure are as follows:

- Inability to communicate
- Lack of organization
- System scope too large

Therefore, effective requirements management involves two aspects: **oriented toward requirements** and **oriented toward managing requirements**.

Based on personal experience, I have chosen to analyze the project management tool Worktile.

## Analysis

So, how does Worktile address the issues mentioned above?

### First, Answer What Worktile Is

From the official website introduction:

> Worktile Kanban-style task collaboration allows team members to synchronize board changes in real-time through easy drag-and-drop of task cards, enabling agile collaboration. A lightweight team collaboration tool that lets your team start collaborating in just 5 minutes, boosting efficiency. It's simple, intuitive, easy to use, free, and offers unlimited members, projects, and storage space—fly with your team.

After organizing, I found it has the following **features**:

- Project-oriented Kanban-style task management

  Clearly divides tasks and keeps track of project status in real-time. Each task includes checklists, assignees, deadlines, attachments, comments, etc.

- File synchronization functionality

  Somewhat similar to GitHub but not as powerful; personally, I find it a bit redundant.

- Shared team calendar

  Provides a macro view of the team's work plans and schedules.

- Message notifications

  Notifications for new task assignments, reminders to check a file, or new comments.

- Analytical statistical views

  Quantifies tasks visually, showing project progress, task allocation among team members, project activity trends, etc., through charts.

After understanding its features, the next focus is on how to use Worktile for requirements management.

### Using Worktile for Requirements Management

Analyzing how Worktile reflects the requirements management process:

> - Proposing requirements
>
>   Record change requirements in detail, treating it as a memo or inbox. The requester should be able to easily record detailed information about the requirement.
>
> - Review
>
>   Confirm whether to implement the change requirement. This process involves evaluating the change, confirming if the requirement needs to be changed, and its impact on existing components.

In Worktile, different change processes are displayed through task lists.

**Inbox:** Anyone can submit change requirement requests in this task list. When you feel there is a need to address a requirement, you can add it here.
**To Do:** Requirements confirmed to be implemented can be placed in this list, with relevant assignees added.
**In Progress:** This list clearly shows requirements currently being worked on, providing insight into product progress.
**Completed:** Completed requirements can be placed in a dedicated list for easy tracking later.

> - Implementation
>
>   Carry out specific implementation based on the detailed requirements, which may involve product, development, and design personnel.
>
> - Confirmation
>
>   Ensure the quality of the requirement's outcome, confirming that the implementation is correct.
>
> - Measurement
>
>   Perform metric analysis on the requirement process. This step is crucial and meaningful for requirements management. Analyzing these requirements reveals the current project's progress and existing issues.

Use labels to define task attributes and task priorities to define the priority of requirement handling.

If a change requirement is confirmed not to be implemented, simply archive it for future reference.

In Worktile's project analysis statistical views, label statistics can be performed. The value for requirements management lies in analyzing requirement attributes to understand the current product's progress, how many user pain points have been resolved, and using list statistics to track requirement completion:

### Solving Problems

After analyzing Worktile, we can now answer the initial question: **How does Worktile solve the previously mentioned problems?**

We can use Worktile to flexibly implement the requirements management process. Its intuitive tasks, discussion platform, and various project views allow us to easily define the system. Combined with good management, it helps avoid issues like ambiguous system boundaries.

Using Worktile, we can conveniently record requirement changes. Combined with discussion and notification features, it facilitates simple collaboration and communication, allowing every member to participate.

Additionally, we can leverage its statistical analysis functions to easily measure and analyze project requirements, assessing the current change status of the entire project.

Thus, Worktile addresses issues in requirements management, personnel organization, and communication.

Finally, requirements management is just one part of overall project management and should not be separated from other project management elements.

Requirements management is only one aspect where Worktile can be effective. Beyond this, through the aforementioned features, Worktile enables management of the entire project lifecycle, providing conceptual integrity.
