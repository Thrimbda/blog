During that joyful and intoxicating seven-day trip to Chengdu three summers ago, I probably never imagined I would return to this city in less than four years.

With what kind of mood, carrying what kind of burdens, and intending to pursue what kind of aspirations.

<!--more-->

I heard as early as the freshman orientation that the Software School had internships for juniors, either in Kunshan or Chengdu. Time flew by, and soon during the winter break of my junior year, I received the news that we were coming to Chengdu.

My study plans during the winter break were never really implemented. By now, I had only finished reading *The Mythical Man-Month*, and most of my productive work time was spent on that annoying personal project, which still isn't completely finished. I guess I fell into the so-called "tar pit." But then again, time wasn't entirely wasted—working on a project is better than playing games and regretting it later, or so I think.

## The Trip to Chengdu

Speaking of Chengdu, to an outsider like me, it's a foodie's paradise, a leisure capital, the Land of Abundance. But I'm not much of a foodie, so in that sense, Chengdu doesn't hold much appeal for me. However, during the summer after high school, I promised a classmate we'd travel together—doing someone a favor—so I came along. After checking flight prices back then, we found tickets to Chongqing were very cheap, so we decided to spend two days in Chongqing first, then take a high-speed train to Chengdu. Eating and drinking along the way, it felt just as we expected. I did get to see the laid-back lifestyle of Chengdu locals; sometimes seeing old Chengdu residents strolling leisurely on the streets made me relax too. Unfortunately, I was distracted back then, always thinking about other things, so that trip didn't feel real.

So now, there's no sense of novelty left, and I haven't attached any unrealistic expectations to this internship. My only hope is that I can settle down and focus.

Apart from almost going to the wrong train station (a place called Xi'an South Station that I'd never been to), the journey went smoothly. Our group of six arrived in this relaxed city just fine.

Our destination was in the northwest of Chengdu, in the suburbs of Pi County. It was said to be a two-hour drive, and I fully expected it to be some desolate place. We got off the train around six in the evening. At the station, an uncle followed us from the moment we exited, trying to get his first fare of the day. Annoyed, we gave in to his wish—25 yuan per person for the six of us to get to our stop, which seemed reasonable.

**And that's when I learned how skilled Chengdu drivers are.**

Dozens of traffic lights, and the driver uncle, taking advantage of the still-dark sky, didn't stop at a single one. A seven-seater van, cruising at 80 km/h the whole way without a hint of fear—even wilder than Xi'an's taxi drivers.

Upon arrival, I found it much prettier than I imagined, not at all like a county town, but more like a big city with towering buildings.

### About Jingrong Town

After living here for a few days, this place feels strange, even eerie—so few people, yet everywhere is filled with zealous encouragement for entrepreneurship: giant banners with photos of Ma Yun, Lei Jun, Li Yanhong, even Steve Jobs and Bill Gates hanging on roadside high-rises, and three coffee shops in just one block. It all feels a bit over the top.

So, driven by intense curiosity, I searched on Zhihu and found these results:

- [Jingrong Town, Chengdu's first entrepreneurship-themed town, will it become the next Zhongguancun?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/38584390)
- [How do you evaluate the current state and future trends of Chengdu's internet industry?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/38545586)

In summary, it's a modern town built in response to the national "mass entrepreneurship" call, rising from the leftover properties of Foxconn. Currently in its early development stage, the government has set up the infrastructure and now offers attractive benefits to attract investment and talent, aiming to develop into an incubation base for entrepreneurs and companies. This is related to the new development policies of Chengdu's new mayor, with the ultimate goal of becoming the next Zhongguancun, or even the next Silicon Valley.

But I also think entrepreneurship requires both environment and methodology; it shouldn't just be about hype. As for how this place will develop in the future, we'll have to wait and see.

## New Semester, "New Atmosphere"

I thought we'd arrive to an excellent internet speed, a comfortable environment, and individual workstations. Who knew we'd still have classes, with no internet in the dorm and poor connection in the classroom.

In such an environment, I perfectly missed the retake registration for Probability Theory and the sign-up for Software Project Management :) (just by one hour).

As for why I have one retake and one make-up exam: the former is because I slacked off during a deferred exam, didn't study seriously, failed, and even lost the chance to skip the exam; the latter is because I missed too many classes and was barred from taking the exam. But looking on the bright side, my university experience is now complete :)

Ultimately, it's because I never know what's going on in my own head—I just don't pay attention to my own affairs, so setbacks like this are pretty common for me.

Missing registration nowadays, with increasingly strict school management, probably means I'll see those courses next semester.

Anyway, live and learn.
