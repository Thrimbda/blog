"title": "The Play 'Copenhagen': A Quantum Observation Experiment in the Depths of Human Nature"
"summary": "This article centers on the play 'Copenhagen,' which uses the historical mystery of the 1941 meeting between Heisenberg and Bohr in Copenhagen as its backdrop to explore the complex motivations and uncertainties within human nature. The author argues that, compared to the historical truth itself, the behavioral motivations of individuals in a superposition of multiple identities hold greater research value. The article provides a detailed analysis of how the play, through the soulful dialogue of its three protagonists, conducts a quantum experiment on ethics, morality, and humanity on the stage of war, knowledge, and interpersonal relationships. The author shares their personal experience of watching the play, quotes lines from it, and elaborates on how quantum mechanics repositions humanity at the center of the universe and the unknowability of the depths of human nature. Finally, the author reflects on the meaning of writing, emphasizing that the intensity of life lies in constantly challenging oneself and extracting the marrow from experience, rather than pursuing perfection."

## The Mystery of Copenhagen

_History may become increasingly elusive as more historical materials emerge; we should focus on the invariants within human nature beneath the surface._

In 1941, German scientist Werner Heisenberg traveled to Copenhagen, Denmark, which was then occupied by Germany, to visit his former teacher, Niels Bohr. However, this reunion after four years ended quite unpleasantly, abruptly concluding the meeting and completely severing their nearly two-decade-long deep friendship. Perhaps, it also forever altered the fate of the world.

This is the famous "Mystery of the Copenhagen Meeting."

For decades, people have debated the truth of this event. After the declassification of relevant archives post-Cold War and the release of more firsthand materials from Heisenberg, Bohr, and scientists from various countries associated with them, it has become possible to roughly determine what happened during this meeting and what Heisenberg said to Bohr that caused Bohr's fury and their eventual parting.

> "The conversation took place during an evening walk. I knew Bohr was under surveillance by German authorities, so I tried to conduct the conversation in a way that wouldn't endanger myself. The conversation likely began with my question: '**Is it right for physicists to work on uranium fission during wartime?**' because progress in this field could lead to severe consequences for the war.
> Bohr immediately understood the meaning of the question and looked somewhat frightened. I recall him asking in return: 'Do you really think uranium fission can be used to make weapons?' I probably replied: 'In principle, it's possible, but it requires immense technical effort. We can only hope it won't be achieved during this war.'
> Bohr was shocked by my answer, clearly thinking I was conveying a message that Germany had made significant progress in developing atomic weapons. Although I later tried to correct this misunderstanding, I likely didn't fully regain Bohr's trust, especially since I only dared to speak cautiously (which was absolutely my mistake) because I feared certain words might be used against me later. I was very dissatisfied with the outcome of this conversation."

> "I am particularly thinking of our conversation at the institute. During that conversation, the topic of 'war' came up, and I clearly remember every word we said.
> You began by saying you were convinced that if the war lasted long enough, it would be decided by atomic weapons, which left a deep impression on me. At the time, I knew nothing about the preparations underway in America. Just as I was somewhat skeptical, you added that I should understand one thing: you had been almost entirely preoccupied with this problem in recent years and had no doubt it could be solved.
> Therefore, your statement that 'you had hinted to me that German physicists would do everything to prevent the application of atomic technology' is something I cannot understand at all. During this brief exchange, I was very cautious and thought a great deal."
>
> _In 1961, on Heisenberg's sixtieth birthday, Bohr wrote a letter to Heisenberg but never sent it. The letter was finally made public in 2002._

Historians of natural science generally believe that the outcome of the conversation likely had a profound impact on the direction of atomic bomb development and deployment during World War II by the two major warring factions, the nuclear threats faced by the world today, and the future development of science and human survival.

However, the declassification of historical materials did not resolve the core mystery: **Why** did Heisenberg go to Copenhagen? What was his **motivation**?

In my view, compared to the uncertain historical truth, the uncertainty of human behavior and motivation resulting from the superposition of multiple identities holds greater research value. After all, history is a mirror. What we, as observers and the ones reflected in the mirror, can see and feel from it, and how that shapes our perception of the real world and, in turn, how we use that perception to interact with reality, is the most exquisite and fascinating value of this mirror for us.

## 'Copenhagen' as a Play

_A profound discussion of the antinomies arising from the complexity of human nature and the limitations of the human mind._

To explore the chaotic uncertainty in the depths of human nature—the intricate and complex **motivations** of humans—in the play 'Copenhagen,' the three protagonists: Heisenberg, Bohr, and Bohr's wife Margrethe appear on stage as spirits in a void. Driven by their obsession with the truth of this mystery, they reenact that fateful meeting in the afterlife, unraveling the threads amidst the complex and contradictory superposition of identities and the uncertainty of human nature.

![theme](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/06/18/theme.jpg)

Why are "motivations" complex?

Because the real world is complex, containing an overwhelming amount of information, with participants interacting in collective unconsciousness; history is complex, evolving amidst countless contradictions, mingled with chance and necessity. We cannot, in a mechanistic materialist manner, dissect history, the people who constitute it, the environments that shaped them, their decisions and thoughts, and their relationships with each other, hoping to divide and conquer to obtain any meaningful answers.

Structure itself contains immense information, such that when the parts of a whole organically combine, countless unexpected new phenomena emerge.

Fortunately, humans are inherently fascinated by complex information that exceeds our processing capacity. Using complex reality as its raw material, 'Copenhagen' constructs its unique stage; by isolating and exploring various issues related to human nature in reality, 'Copenhagen' conducts an exquisite quantum experiment on humanity.

It highly condenses the most heart-wrenching and conflict-ridden parts of real history to form its solid stage foundation:

First, war—the most devastating war in human history divides the three protagonists into opposing camps; then, knowledge is involved—the grand edifice of theory has just been built, and with the discovery of nuclear fission, the development of nuclear weapons becomes possible, raising suffocating moral challenges; finally, human connections tie everything together—father and son, teacher and disciple, placing the relationship between Heisenberg and Bohr, who are at the eye of the storm, at the center, constructing its most simple yet magnificent stage.

Upon this grand and solid stage foundation, three vivid protagonists take the stage. With extreme care, their lives, values, achievements, and emotions are restored in the work. The experimental conditions are ready, so the most crucial energy element is added—Heisenberg's mysterious motivation for going to Copenhagen initiates this breathtaking experiment. Maintaining a scientific attitude during the experiment, allowing contradictions to develop freely, letting participants collide violently to produce dazzling sparks. In this process, using lines that are casual, everyday, intense, or gentle, it profoundly discusses topics such as ethics, morality, human nature, and fate, ultimately presenting the audience with an unparalleled masterpiece overflowing with information.

## The Quantum Laws in the Depths of Human Nature

_As the old saying goes, "There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's eyes."_

The role of good literary and artistic works is not to state a fact or provide specific solutions to certain problems. In my view, their value and significance lie precisely in using a poetic, ambiguous imagery to reach the human soul, allowing people to gain some kind of revelation. And this revelation is also like a mirror; everyone can observe different things—whether it's a discussion of ethics and morality; a critique of reality; an interrogation of human nature; or emotional resonance, a knowing smile, trembling tears, fear, anxiety, anger, warmth, fascination... It seems like an infinite source of energy, adding many colors and a bit more weight to our life processes.

In the summer of 2018, the company where I interned was located in Wudaokou. I had just graduated from university, like a blank sheet of paper; dragged by a fellow intern senior to Peking University to watch this graduate performance of 'Copenhagen.' Since then, this play, resonating with real-life experiences, has echoed in my mind like a chain reaction, growing increasingly intense.

For me, that poetic revelation began with the following lines:

When reviewing the establishment of the "Copenhagen Interpretation," Bohr says to Heisenberg:

> **Bohr** It works, yes. But it’s more important than that. Because you see what we did in those three years, Heisenberg? Not to exaggerate, but we turned the world inside out! Yes, listen, now it comes, now it comes .… We put man back at the centre of the universe. Throughout history we keep finding ourselves displaced. We keep exiling ourselves to the periphery of things. First we turn ourselves into a mere adjunct of God’s unknowable purposes, tiny figures kneeling in the great cathedral of creation. And no sooner have we recovered ourselves in the Renaissance, no sooner has man become, as Protagoras proclaimed him, the measure of all things, than we’re pushed aside again by the products of our own reasoning! We’re dwarfed again as physicists build the great new cathedrals for us to wonder at—the laws of classical mechanics that predate us from the beginning of eternity, that will survive us to eternity’s end, that exist whether we exist or not. Until we come to the beginning of the twentieth century, and we’re suddenly forced to rise from our knees again.
>
> **Heisenberg** It starts with Einstein.
>
> **Bohr** It starts with Einstein. He shows that measurement—measurement, on which the whole possibility of science depends—measurement is not an impersonal event that occurs with impartial universality. It’s a human act, carried out from a specific point of view in time and space, from the one particular viewpoint of a possible observer. Then, here in Copenhagen in those three years in the mid-twenties we discover that there is no precisely determinable objective universe. That the universe exists only as a series of approximations. Only within the limits determined by our relationship with it. Only through the understanding lodged inside the human head.

Are we the masters of all things?

> If people measured themselves by strictly discernible quantities... then we would need a novel quantum ethics.

Our own chaos and complexity as masters mean that people do not always understand each other. Even we ourselves are sometimes unknowable, so we are always searching, trying to unravel the mysteries left in the past.

> We are still searching when our lives end.

The world will not end with humanity.

> Everything was spared, very likely, precisely because of that brief moment in Copenhagen, that event that can never be located or defined, that ultimate core of the essential uncertainty of all things.

## Postscript

Like many poems I love, I swallowed this play whole. Then, at certain moments in life, it always sparks into my mind bit by bit. I begin to savor, chew, and ponder it, absorbing some wisdom, or at least gaining a bit of pleasure.

But is that enough?

For years, I've had the impulse to write this article. But one day in 2019, after typing the title on my computer and staring blankly for several hours, I almost trembled and gave up. What kind of depth, wisdom, and breadth must a person possess to write a review of this play that wouldn't be self-humiliating?—I was too young, I had none of these things, I wasn't worthy of writing it.

But is retreating with such an attitude acceptable? Then, expecting to continue recklessly, swallowing all sorts of good things whole, without seeking deep understanding, wasting precious resources, all the way until 90 years old, hoping to have an epiphany in the process and turn decay into magic?

No, that is a waste of life. It makes the taste of everything too bland, and a life too bland is not worth living.

> Verse, Fame, and Beauty are intense indeed.
> But Death's intenser -- Death is Life's high meed.

So, before dying, live as intensely as possible. But what is intense?

It is the rich aroma of life;
It is the radiance of human nature;
Perhaps it is the Olympic spirit, challenging oneself and pushing limits;
It is making oneself a bridge, a path toward the Übermensch;
It is the tree on the mountain, rooted in the darkest depths, growing toward the highest sky, and then waiting for the thunder.

Thus, we welcome the highest reward of our lives, and death becomes intense as a result.

Life is servitude; death is rest. An intense life deserves an even more intense death.

Today, compared to the depth, wisdom, and breadth needed to write that **perfect** review, I am still destitute, young, and shallow. But perhaps what matters is not "perfection," but the determination to extract the marrow from experience. Perhaps it is precisely each act of extracting the marrow that increases a person's depth, wisdom, and breadth. Perhaps only in this way does life become more intense.
