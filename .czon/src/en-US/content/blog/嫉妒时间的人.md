"title": "The One Who Envies Time"
"summary": "This article explores the nonlinear nature of time through Bryan's perspective, arguing that time is not a flat line but a complex, interconnected web. It delves into how the human heart is encoded and transmitted through language, and how the projection of time onto the heart evokes emotions like curiosity and inferiority. Bryan envies the marks time leaves on others but ultimately resolves to face it bravely, learning to distinguish between what changes and what remains constant in time, and believing that time will make him more exuberant. The article also discusses time's role in shaping the consistency of the human heart, the relative shifts between joy and melancholy, and emphasizes the importance of balance and loyalty to oneself."

"Drink! Plasma Egg, it is the fate of your kind!" Bryan, having just finished his shower and refilled the water for the red bowl on the floor, mustered his strength and spoke in a deep, resonant tone.

Plasma Egg and Bryan did not share a common language. In fact, between the two of them, only one could speak. Though it sounded a bit far-fetched, what Bryan said was at least true—who doesn't need to drink water?

## Time Is Not a Flat Line

> Time was later proven not to be one-dimensional as people thought. Or rather, describing it merely as "one-dimensional" is insufficient to express its intricate, web-like structure.

If this secret were made public, everyone would surely think Bryan was mad.

But once the taste of truth is savored, it becomes irresistible. Even if kept as a secret locked away in his heart, never to be shared with another human, enduring immense loneliness, Bryan would still follow his curiosity and continue seeking evidence. After all, this truth was born in his mind, in his memories—more precisely, it was born from another unspeakable secret in his heart. It was a terrifying [thought experiment](<https://0xc1.space/2018/08/13/Sleeping%20to%20dream/>) that had kept Bryan in a state of fear and anxiety for six months and forty days.

### The Human Heart

Yet, phenomena related to time are also connected to the human heart. As is well known, people imprison themselves (whether intentionally or unintentionally), keeping their hearts forever hidden from the light of day. Observing another's heart is even more impossible. We can only use language to project our hearts—from their rich, complex states—onto a straight line and hand it to another person, then pray for their genius to reconstruct our hearts, which have been distorted by linearity.

However, there are moments when our hearts inadvertently flicker into someone else's, or vice versa. At such times, expressions appear on people's faces—most often a smile, sometimes a bittersweet happiness. Because the heart is confined within a prison of its own design or making, the most cruel states of mind are curiosity and shyness. Bryan understood deeply the pain that comes from being curious about another's heart. Whether in sunshine or rain, one can only guess based on meager evidence. And shyness intensifies the pain brought by curiosity.

### The Human Heart Encoded into Language

Fortunately, most of the time, things are not associated with pain.

Bryan sometimes tries to explain his understanding of time to others. For instance, the process by which the human heart constructs another's heart through the language it carries is not, in fact, an isolated point existing solely on a timeline, as most people imagine. Sometimes, a person's words can suddenly take effect years later, like finally obtaining the key to a puzzle. Thus, language, combined with the workings of time, moves freely through this world. Since people cannot foresee the future, it is difficult to perceive this effect. Even if they do sense it, they can never describe it to another—the equation has already been introduced with too many unknowns.

For those who have long spoken a particular language, they sometimes use the same, not necessarily correct, pattern to construct and interpret the hearts hidden within language. If one suddenly switches to another language, unfamiliarity with the language itself makes one instinctively more cautious, allowing the language to connect more directly to the heart. Bryan has a foreign friend with whom he once shared a campfire. Their exchanges often made Bryan aware of this. However, compared to the role of language itself, the similarity of human hearts is the solid foundation of friendship.

### The Projection of Time onto the Human Heart

It is precisely because of this unknowability of the future, the grasp and memory of the past, and existing at different points in the web of time that immense differences and similarities arise between people. **Therefore, Bryan envies time, or rather, envies the marks time leaves on a person.** This envy is actually composed of two distinct emotions:

The first is the aforementioned curiosity—curiosity about how many linguistic riddles this person has solved in different times, curiosity about the gifts and reproaches time has bestowed upon another heart, making it exuberant. Curiosity about whether he, using the same time as a measure, could experience the suffering and joy of another heart, and whether he, too, could become exuberant.

This leads to the second emotion: a deep sense of inferiority. Broadly speaking, lacking the effects of time means lacking countless keys—unable to unlock the secrets left in the language of those who came before, and unable to powerfully form new words and new languages to encode one's own heart in new forms. Narrowly speaking, due to the asynchronicity of time, the probability of influencing another heart through non-linguistic means is greatly reduced. Bryan asked himself if he was laughably naive. Even now, I can understand a bit of this feeling of his.

In the end, Bryan decided not to be a coward. He began learning to distinguish between what changes and what remains constant in time, and he believed that time would ultimately make him exuberant as well.

### The Effect of Time on the Human Heart

In the face of impartial time, the power of relative effects begins to manifest: "Hidden melancholy has her sovereign shrine." This is almost the line of poetry Bryan has chewed over the longest. As time passes, more and more keys become available to unlock parts of its mystery, allowing him to savor different nuances.

Bryan discovered that persistently tasting melancholy amidst joy is an expression of consistency. Because only within the same frame of reference does the latter emerge from a lingering attachment to the former. In a book Bryan recently read, this consistency spanned an astonishing fifty-three years.

However, consistency is ultimately a precious quality. More often, as time flows, the human heart changes. Simplified to the binary relative effects we're discussing, this manifests as joy becoming平淡 (flat) as it increases, and melancholy diminishing over time. The most tragic scenario is when past joy turns into pain, and past melancholy loses all meaning. Bryan calls this change betrayal.

He would never allow such betrayal of himself to happen again. But as long as the rhythm is appropriate, balance will naturally emerge, just like the eyes one sees for the first time on a poplar tree—those eyes, large and small! It's hard to see them without an exuberant heart.

### Time Ceases in the Sound of Plasma Egg's Snoring

So, what exactly are the things that change in time, and what are the things that remain constant? If a friendship that once involved mutual support now seems insignificant, can it be said that the hearts that existed in that time have died?

Or perhaps each person is reborn every day, carrying the memories of yesterday's heart, ~~using this discovery as a grand excuse for procrastination~~.

Plasma Egg ultimately accepted her fate and began snoring peacefully. Only then did Bryan realize that time had stopped.
