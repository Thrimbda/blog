It took me two days to set up my own blog, and now I'm bursting with thoughts, wanting to share a few points.

## The Reason Behind It

After returning home on January 25th, I joyfully celebrated the New Year.

I have a flaw: once I'm home on vacation, I absolutely cannot study. Back in high school, homework would occasionally keep me in check on weekends, but now I'm completely unrestrained. However, I couldn't just let myself mess around at home every day. While habits are hard to change, people are adaptable. So, as soon as the New Year festivities were mostly over after the eighth day of the lunar month, I escaped my own clutches and returned to school. The lab has one advantage: no matter how comfortable the environment, I can muster the willpower not to switch to Windows to play games.

After returning to school, I made some changes to my half-baked website and then remembered the personal blog I had long coveted. Previously, because [Jianshu](http://www.jianshu.com/) supported markdown, I eagerly registered. After writing a couple of casual essays, I still felt there were too many restrictions and not enough freedom—call it nitpicking if you will. Seeing [Azheng's blog](https://zccz14.com/) thriving, I immediately felt I needed to learn a thing or two.

## Getting Hands-On

Actually, Azheng had written a tutorial: [*Elegantly Using Hexo*](https://zccz14.com/2016/12/30/%E4%BC%98%E9%9B%85%E5%9C%B0%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8Hexo/); it was very detailed, and following it step by step would quickly get the blog set up. But initially, I missed it, so I dove in with full enthusiasm to figure things out on my own.

Because of the above, I decided not to write another tutorial myself. Instead, I'll simply record my **journey of thoughts**, adding links where appropriate.

First, I noticed the Hexo blog framework. After a night of research, I set up the Hexo blog, installed the NexT theme, configured it myself, deployed it to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and set up domain name resolution.

At this point, the blog was complete, and I could have stopped here. But I still felt that updating this static blog required manually generating and deploying each time, which was a bit cumbersome. I wanted to see if there was a way to make this already convenient solution even more convenient—in short, I was lazy, lazy as hell. ~~But then again, isn't the world propelled forward by lazy people trying to make their laziness more comfortable?~~

Then, I discovered a pinned blog post by the initiator of NexT (the theme), discussing whether Travis CI's automated build and continuous integration service—a boon to humanity—could be used to automatically update the blog. But since I had to wake up early the next morning, I first migrated two articles from my Jianshu account to fill this beautiful vase and went to bed early.

Yesterday, I was out having fun all day and didn't touch this. Today, back in the lab, I continued tinkering. Suddenly, I found Azheng's tutorial on using Travis for automated deployment. It was on a whole other level, truly impressive:

> - Quick Deployment
>
>   Leveraging Git's features, keep version-controlled files small and numerous, containing only the source code.
>
> - Automated Deployment
>
>   No need to manually use `hexo deploy` for deployment. Just push the source code to GitHub, and it deploys automatically.
>
> - No Installation Required
>
>   You can write/publish blog posts even without a node.js environment, hexo CLI tools, or even Git.

With this, I was satisfied with my blog setup.

## Bursting with Thoughts

Afterward, as the concluding section of this inaugural post to mark the blog's completion, I want to use this silly-sounding phrase I coined an hour ago as the title for this section, expressing the little insight I've gained.

New Year, new beginnings! This is also the first post after the Lunar New Year.

Previously, for the linear algebra exam, I frantically studied from scratch for three days. Every day, I marveled: if only I could work this hard every day in my daily life. As the saying goes, "A steed's single leap cannot cover ten paces; a nag's ten-day journey succeeds through perseverance." This is probably an example, and I'm no steed.

In fact, this should be a lifelong goal for me: perseverance.

To have hope in your heart and walk steadily toward it.
