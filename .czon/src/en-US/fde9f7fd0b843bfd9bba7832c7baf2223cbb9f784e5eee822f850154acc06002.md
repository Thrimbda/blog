"title": "Little Paw Prints on the Curtain"
"summary": "Using cat paw prints on a curtain as a starting point, the author reflects late at night on the passage of time, witnessing life, and personal growth. By revisiting Frank Lloyd Wright's autobiography, the author explores two core concepts: style and taste. Style is a unique expression that naturally emerges after mastering the fundamentals, like Van Gogh's paintings. Taste is the ability to appreciate art, built through training and life experiences, such as understanding Keats' poetry or the play *Copenhagen*. The article combines personal experiences, like watching plays and reading autobiographies, to illustrate how these concepts influence life, ultimately returning to a longing for a rich and fulfilling existence."

A while ago, I returned to Suzhou. Grape didn’t come back with me. As I turned off the lights and prepared to sleep, I noticed several deep little paw prints on the curtain. I couldn’t hold back any longer. In the middle of the night, I got out of bed and began to think about the more than half a month Grape had spent alone at home—time, and the things that have flowed with it, influencing my life.

In a previous article, we discussed the shape of time, its power, its playfulness and mockery. One point that deserves special emphasis is that the speed at which time passes varies depending on a person’s state. The Boss and I have observed that recently, it seems to be accelerating exponentially—so much so that half of this year seems to have passed in an instant. Yet, upon closer reflection, it seems last year was the same. I always feel as though not much time has passed since I last wrote, but it has already been over a year.

Although this year has been fast, it has also been rich. Beyond richness, it has carried the breath of life and the act of witnessing life.

And indeed, all of this began over a year ago, in the days before time began to accelerate, with a book—an architect who wrote himself into its pages.

***

On February 11 of that year, daidai sent me a picture of a book cover that read: `An Autobiography: Frank Lloyd Wright`.

“You’ll like it.”

And so, this architect, who despised sentimentality yet was delicate and rich, came to life in my mind.

By revisiting his life, he taught me two important things for witnessing this world:

The first is **style**. The formation of style requires time to catalyze. First, we must solidly master the basics, reaching a state where we act freely without overstepping boundaries. Take riding a bicycle as an example: eventually, you don’t need your hands to steer; you use your body, or your heart. If you think about riding over the solid line on the bike lane, you won’t deviate. After the foundation is laid, it becomes a process of specific creation—facing a problem area, raising the questions that trouble us along the critical path, and then using the foundation we’ve built to solve problems or express emotions.

**At the moment we put the finishing touches, style quietly arrives. What we must do then is welcome and appreciate it—a moment of joy.**

What is style? It’s like the tangible colors in the objective world. Take Van Gogh’s paintings, for instance. He exaggeratedly expresses certain phenomena in the world, sparing no ink, and in some parts, his strokes could be described as quite rough, creating a strong sense of recognition. This recognition is the embodiment of style. However, everyone appreciates this beauty in different ways—or may not even find it beautiful at all. Is the understanding of style entirely subjective?

What is good style? This leads to the second important thing the architect discussed: **taste**. Who possesses such good taste that they can appreciate a specific work of art and savor the style that leaps from it?

Like the cypress trees and starry nights in Van Gogh’s brushstrokes; the haunting song of the nightingale in Keats’ poetry; Beethoven’s picturesque, vibrant Sixth Symphony. These universally acclaimed works are each unique, yet they all possess a solid, graceful power that transcends time and space, breaks through the barriers of the human heart, strengthens people, gives them meaning, and lends coherence to life.

However, appreciating these works undoubtedly requires a certain degree of training. Take “Ode on Melancholy” as an example: `Aye, in the very temple of delight, Veil’d Melancholy has her sovran shrine`. When I first read it, I was at an age where I had just gained an adult’s mind but was still inexperienced in the world. I only felt the meaning of this line was obscure. As I learned about Keats’ life and began to pay homage to the shrine of melancholy in my own life, it started to grow in my heart in a unique way.

Or take drama as an example: `“Why did Heisenberg return to Copenhagen in 1941?”` Why did that brief meeting at Bohr’s home in Copenhagen end the twenty-year friendship between Heisenberg and Bohr? This question, which has lingered in the public’s mind for over half a century, serves as a clue in the play *Copenhagen*, forming the background and foundational framework of the entire play. In reality, it cleverly dramatizes how complex the human heart can be. Behind a single decision or action collapsed into reality, there may be dozens or even hundreds of motives in a state of superposition.

Heisenberg was an old friend of the Bohr family and also a German who shared the guilt of war crimes. He was like Bohr’s most outstanding son, yet he also bore the roles of husband and father himself. His motives were even more numerous than his identities: Did Heisenberg want to prevent the birth of nuclear weapons? Did he want to shoulder the burden of reviving the entire German scientific community? Was it because Heisenberg had become the youngest professor in all of Germany? Or was Heisenberg simply like a homesick child? Or perhaps Heisenberg himself didn’t even know why he came, and this state of confusion and chaos expanded exponentially like a chain reaction, ultimately saving all the cities that were not bombed with nuclear weapons by Axis Germany. Humanity! A collection of contradictions!

In the summer of 2018, Little Lion took me to see this play on the Peking University campus. Since then, it has lingered in my heart, growing richer with each revisit. This is perhaps the process of building taste: first, it enters my memory, and as life goes on, scenes from the play are enacted in reality in various different yet interconnected ways, allowing me to appreciate it further. At the same time, it also guides my real life, granting equal respect to the dozens of motives behind others’ decisions.

So what is taste?

You could say taste is entirely dogmatic, a logically self-consistent virtual system that builds bridges between people’s hearts, with destinations entirely unrestricted. You could also say taste should be objective, transcending personal likes and dislikes, merely a reflection of the real world in the human heart.

The architect didn’t provide an answer; he simply assumed the existence of taste. Whether dogmatic or an objective existence, it is contradictory yet unified. It must reflect some attribute of reality, rarely contradicting it, yet not stopping at reality and mechanical materialism. It guides human rationality and aesthetics, constructing civilization upon the foundation of the real environment. These rich works provide me with raw materials, like poetry. At first encounter, they may not be understood, but with frequent reflection and resonance, they come to constitute my taste.

Style and taste, like `apply` and `eval`, follow the way of nature, constructing the architect’s tumultuous yet abundant life.

*Every time I open that autobiography, no matter my mood, I eventually return to a harmonious tranquility. How should a person spend their life? I hope to be as rich as the architect.*

When I read about Frank’s final decision to join Sullivan’s firm and bid farewell to his former boss, he described it in his autobiography like this:

![Pain](https://0xc1.space/images/2020/09/13/pain.jpg)

This scene lingered in my memory for a long time, until I had a similar experience and realized that all the preparations were useless—the pain came unexpectedly. Just like the little paw prints on the curtain, during the days and nights I was away, Grape walked onto the bay window countless times, scratching the curtain with her little paws, earnestly hoping that the moment she scratched, I would appear behind the curtain to respond. She scratched and scratched, and her claws, sharp from not being trimmed for too long, caught on the curtain, pulling out those little paw prints.
