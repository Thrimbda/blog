2017-02-05 Update:

A few days ago, I happened to meet a senior at a gathering who also attended the same university as me. During casual conversation, he asked which high school I went to. I said, "Huanghe." He exclaimed in surprise, "Then you must have been the top scorer at your school!"

Since starting university, I've been asked this question many times by local Xi'an classmates. The responses are either exclamations like the one above or simply not knowing about that high school.

Actually, I wish I could say, "I was dead last in my high school."

## Explanation of the Title

The title contains two very colloquial words: **活宝 (huóbǎo)** and **绝活 (juéhuó)**. While those who understand will understand, I still feel it's necessary to explain, as a matter of responsibility.

These words absolutely carry a strong personal flavor—they were the catchphrases of my high school homeroom teacher, Old Cao. Having studied under Old Cao, you probably heard such phrases countless times over the long three years. Yet, even three years after graduation, I dare not say I have mastered his teachings. It's more like I stood at the gate, stuck my head in, and took a look around. As for **what gate this is, and what constitutes a gate**, I hope you will ponder carefully.

This piece is dedicated to all my juniors from high school.

## Self-Introduction

Due to a certain incomplete professional habit, I don't want to place too many restrictions on the readers of this article. Therefore, I won't make more restrictive assumptions about you than being my juniors—I shouldn't be seen as your senior who is three years older, nor six years older.

With this in mind, I hope you simply view me as the **basic**, **label-free** **person** I describe myself to be—I hope you can clearly understand my purpose in writing this.

## Sima Zhao's Intentions

As for why I wrote this article, I struggled with it for a long time but could never find a proper justification for giving a dedicatory preface to others. We are so contradictory: how capable must one be to have the qualification to stand at a certain height and educate others? **He neither needs this qualification nor can he ever truly attain it.**

So, I'll simply stop worrying about the qualification issue. I'm writing because there's a long-hidden impulse within me to tell a story, to share life experience. But deep down, I feel that by telling you, I can summarize and account for (my past) self: mutual benefit is not a bad thing.

## In a Group of Three, There is Always a Teacher

In high school, I considered myself exceptionally clever. To this day, I have never admired someone solely because they were smart. However, I still enjoy interacting with clever people because communication is easier. **But back then, I didn't understand the difference between being clever and being young.**

In my first year of high school, there was a classmate we called J.
J's mind was incredibly sharp, so much so that even I thought he was clever back then. Where there is brilliance, there is mutual appreciation. High school textbook knowledge is one-sided and full of holes (knowledge gaps), especially in physics, chemistry, and biology. On almost every page, you could find questions hinted at but not explained in the book. So, we would take these questions to the teachers' office next door every day to bother them—this is a highly commendable learning attitude. Sometimes, the teachers would think for a moment and give us the answer; other times, they would brush us off with reasons like `"It's not on the college entrance exam."`—Looking back now, maybe our questions were indeed too tricky. But at the time, we immediately elevated it to the level of `"The Chinese education system is a factory that produces garbage."` We were really too clever.

We quickly became inflated, J even more so. Perhaps it was indeed for this reason that when I recall J now, all that remains is him mentioning the word `"IQ"` every three sentences and his utterly arrogant phrase, `"A bunch of idiots."`

**This is thinking without learning.**

Indeed, I often pondered questions about the stars and the vast universe until midnight. My heart held the sun and moon, but I didn't understand the principle of `"A steed in one leap cannot cover ten paces; a nag traveling ten days achieves its distance through perseverance."` This was a pitfall I stepped into.
J's attitude clearly fell prey to the so-called `"Chinese cramming education,"` but I ultimately did not degenerate alongside J.

In my second year, I changed classes and met another classmate; let's call him Y.
Y studied extremely diligently and was a rule-following student. I don't know how late Y studied every day or if he did nothing but study after returning home—these things are unknown to me. But at school, the Y I could see, except during times like morning exercises that couldn't be used for studying, was always diligently and painstakingly working hard: taking notes seriously in class—without even reading them, I could guess he wrote down every word the teacher wrote on the blackboard, perhaps including typos; doing homework seriously after class—when he encountered something he didn't understand (roughly once per problem, excluding those already done), he would ask the top students in the class or the teacher, completely disregarding whether they were chatting with others or doing work that shouldn't be easily interrupted.
Y often had questions during class about something the teacher just explained: not understanding what it meant, when in fact that point had just been covered, while Y was busy copying the previous board notes—if you copy every single word without omission, you can never keep up with the teacher.

I often lamented that if I had even half of Y's diligence, there would be nothing I couldn't accomplish. Yet Y himself, in my view, achieved nothing. Superficially, he appeared hardworking and diligent, but in reality, it was dull and rigid—I call it an advanced form of laziness. Apart from the part of his brain used for rote memorization, the rest probably went unused.

**This is learning without thinking.**

`"Learning without thinking leads to confusion; thinking without learning leads to peril."` We are familiar with many such sayings, understand their meanings, but are just unwilling to carefully ponder the principles they contain. Because we don't grasp these principles, we all tend to lean towards either J or Y to some extent, becoming somewhat tragic figures. Either we are unrecognized talents, our genius buried, or we lack internal understanding and external application, failing to produce results even after three years.

## Swift Horses Are Common

I hope to share my reflections in the previously agreed-upon capacity, but I am unwilling to do so in a didactic, outline-listing manner. As mentioned before, words are the finger, and the principles contained between the lines are the bright moon. Pointing a finger at the moon often makes people mistake the finger for the moon. **It's better to guide you to find it yourselves.**

> One whose breast is filled with roaring thunder yet whose face is like a placid lake is fit to be appointed a supreme general.

This sentence is from *The Art of War*. May we encourage each other with it.
