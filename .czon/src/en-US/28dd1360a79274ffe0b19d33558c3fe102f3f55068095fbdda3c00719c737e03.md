# Ascending the Yuedu Pavilion

Peaks gather like a congregation, waves rage like fury, mountains and rivers guard the road to Tong Pass.

From the Yuedu Pavilion, the eight-hundred-li Qin Plain unfolds before the eyes:

Behold—the crisscrossing paths, the sounds of chickens and dogs, favorable weather, and a land blessed with outstanding people!

Here, one gazes north at the vastness of the Loess Plateau and faces south the grandeur of the Qinling Mountains and Mount Hua; blessed by the mighty flow of the Wei River, it nurtures the splendid and magnificent civilization of China!

May we rise with the rooster's crow and carry forward the legacy!

How fortunate I am to express my aspirations through song.
