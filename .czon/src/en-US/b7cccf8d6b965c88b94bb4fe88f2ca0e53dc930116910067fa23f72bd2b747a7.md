# Demand Management

First, an excerpt from a typical failure example in project management from *The Mythical Man-Month*.

<!--more-->

> **Management Lessons from the Tower of Babel**
>
> According to Genesis, the Tower of Babel was humanity's second great engineering feat after Noah's Ark, but it was also the first complete engineering failure.
>
> This story is profound and instructive in many ways and at various levels. Let's consider it purely as an engineering project and examine the management lessons to be learned. What were the project's initial conditions? Did they have:
>
> 1. A clear goal?
>
>    Yes, though it was naive and nearly impossible. Moreover, the project failed long before encountering this fundamental limitation.
>
> 2. Manpower?
>
>    Plenty.
>
> 3. Materials?
>
>    Abundant clay and tar asphalt in Mesopotamia.
>
> 4. Sufficient time?
>
>    Yes, with no apparent time constraints.
>
> 5. Adequate technology?
>
>    Yes. The pyramid or conical structure itself is stable and effectively distributes pressure loads. Masonry techniques were well-studied. Again, the project failed long before reaching technological limits.
>
> So, given all these conditions, why did the project fail? What were they missing? Two things—**communication** and its result—**organization**. They couldn't talk to each other, so they couldn't cooperate. When cooperation broke down, work ground to a halt. Reading between the lines of history, we infer that the lack of communication led to arguments, frustration, and group suspicion. Soon, tribes began to split—choosing isolation over conflict.

The author analyzed and found that the reasons for this project's failure were:

- Inability to communicate
- Lack of organization
- System scope too large

Therefore, effective demand management involves two aspects: **focusing on demands** and **focusing on demand management**.

After personal experience, I chose to analyze Worktile, a project management tool.

## Analysis

So, how does Worktile address the issues mentioned above?

### First, What is Worktile?

From the official website:

> Worktile is a Kanban-style task collaboration tool. By easily dragging and dropping task cards, team members can synchronize board changes in real time for agile collaboration. A lightweight team collaboration tool that allows your team to start collaborating in just 5 minutes, boosting efficiency. It's simple, intuitive, easy to use, and free, offering unlimited members, projects, and storage space. Fly with your team.

After organizing, I found it has the following **features**:

- Project-oriented Kanban-style task management

  Clearly divides tasks, keeps track of project progress in real time. Each task includes checklists, assignees, deadlines, attachments, comments, etc.

- File synchronization functionality

  Similar to GitHub but less powerful; personally, I find it somewhat awkwardly positioned.

- Shared team calendar

  Provides a macro view of the team's work plans and schedules.

- Message notifications

  Notifications for new task assignments, reminders to check files, or new comments.

- Analytical statistical views

  Quantifies tasks visually, showing project progress, task distribution among team members, and project trend heatmaps through charts.

After understanding its features, the next focus is on how to use Worktile for demand management.

### Using Worktile for Demand Management

Analyzing how Worktile reflects the demand management process:

> - Proposing demands
>
>   Record change demands in detail, acting as a memo or inbox. Demand proposers should easily record detailed information about the demand.
>
> - Reviewing
>
>   Confirm whether to implement the change demand. This process involves evaluating the change, confirming its necessity, and its impact on existing components.

In Worktile, different change processes are displayed through task lists.

**Inbox:** Anyone can submit change demand requests here. When you feel a demand needs addressing, add it here.  
**To Do:** Demands confirmed for implementation can be placed here, with relevant assignees added.  
**In Progress:** This list clearly shows ongoing demands, providing insight into product progress.  
**Completed:** Completed demands can be archived in a dedicated list for future product tracking.

> - Implementation
>
>   Execute based on the detailed requirements of the demand, potentially involving product, development, and design personnel.
>
> - Confirmation
>
>   Ensure the quality of the demand's outcome, confirming correct implementation.
>
> - Measurement
>
>   Analyze and measure the demand process. This step is crucial and meaningful for demand management, as analyzing these demands reveals project progress and existing issues.

Use labels to define task attributes and task priorities to define the priority of demand handling.

If a change demand is confirmed as unnecessary, simply archive it for future reference.

In Worktile's analytical statistical views, label statistics can be performed. The value for demand management lies in analyzing demand attributes to understand current product progress, how many user pain points have been resolved, and using list statistics to track demand completion:

### Solving Problems

After analyzing Worktile, we can now answer the initial question: **How does Worktile solve the previously mentioned problems?**

We can use Worktile to flexibly implement demand management processes. Its intuitive tasks, discussion platform, and multiple project views allow us to easily define systems. Combined with good management, it helps avoid issues like ambiguous system boundaries.

Using Worktile, we can conveniently record change demands. Combined with discussion and notification features, it facilitates simple collaboration and communication, allowing every member to participate.

Additionally, we can leverage its statistical analysis functions to easily measure and analyze project demands, assessing the current state of changes in the entire project.

Thus, Worktile addresses demand management, personnel organization, and communication issues.

Finally, demand management, as part of the entire project management process, should not be separated from other elements of project management.

Demand management is just one aspect where Worktile can make a difference. Beyond this, Worktile, through the features mentioned above, enables management of the entire project lifecycle, providing conceptual completeness.
