"title": "Review of 'Escape Safely from the 21st Century'"
"summary": "This article is a review of the film 'Escape Safely from the 21st Century.' The author, drawing from personal viewing experience, provides an in-depth analysis of how the film contrasts adolescents' aspirations for the future with the harsh realities of adulthood. The review notes that while the first half of the film is filled with laughter, its core is tragic. Through the experiences of three teenagers who suddenly find themselves in 38-year-old bodies, the film reveals the process of shattered dreams. The author is particularly moved by how Cheng Yong, still a teenager at heart, is forced to take on the dirty, burdensome 'work' of the adult world, viewing this sudden deprivation as excessively cruel. Reflecting on their own senior-year internship experience, the author contemplates how people in the real world gradually adapt to role changes, citing 'existence precedes essence' to explain growth as a continuous process of experiencing reality and shaping one's essence. Finally, the author suggests that the film gently shatters a distorted future, and while people in reality cannot resist as fiercely as in the film, they can still retain some of the precious elements of their youth."

# Review of 'Escape Safely from the 21st Century'

> Spoiler warning (feels necessary to mention this to avoid upsetting friends who haven't seen it)

I laughed heartily at the beginning, especially during the 'Busy Big Sister' segment, but the further it went, the more I felt the tragic core beneath. Teenagers are always filled with boundless憧憬 for the future, fantasizing about countless unexpected joys of growing up: getting taller, living independently, supporting themselves, having a career, finding love and seriously building a life together, and embarking on all the wondrous adventures that youth's lack of funds and time previously denied them.

So initially, after finding themselves in 38-year-old bodies, the three teenagers are thrilled, believing their dreams have come true. But within seconds, things start to feel wrong: it turns out the future isn't necessarily as wonderful as imagined in youth. Endless money comes with blood, sweat, and danger. The fruits of a near-death effort driven by a sense of justice are claimed by a superior. A complete physical transformation and cohabitation with a childhood crush come with the revelation that one is, in fact, deeply unhappy.

What saddened me most was seeing 18-year-old Cheng Yong genuinely start to扮演 the 38-year-old version of himself, taking on work that feels inherently dirty and burdensome to him. For a teenager, that's just too cruel. For those of us in reality, if there is a gradual process of disillusionment with our future憧憬 over time, it at least accumulates day by day, the result of being slowly nudged forward by the passage of time. It's not this sudden theft of a少年's dreams, forcing upon him a dark reality he has no choice but to accept.

Fortunately, they could still return to 1999, brawling in the classroom, gathering at the eldest's house to brainstorm solutions, not having to face the helplessness of being 38 every single moment.

This resonated with me deeply. During my final semester of senior year, interning in another city, I could still return to my familiar campus on法定 holidays or for important events. I consciously savored my last moments of campus life, consciously cherished the final times with roommates, friends, and the campus itself, using those moments to solidify my resolve, to bid a slow, proper farewell. Only then could I gradually adapt to this role change, accept living in an elaborate cage I voluntarily jumped into, accept that I no longer had the time or mindset to spend an entire week immersed in, say, The Witcher 3, while living independently in another city.

I now think the phrase 'existence precedes essence' speaks to this: by opening one's heart to reality,用心 experiencing various things, and allowing oneself to be shaped by them—events that are always partly or wholly unsatisfactory (sometimes exceeding expectations, sometimes falling short, a mix of good and bad, I suppose)—that is the real world's impact on the human spirit. It hammers at one's symbolic system, generates desire and love, and finally settles within, becoming one's essence. The journey from 18 to 38 is perhaps precisely this process of spending time existing, forming an essence, constantly pruning the dreams of youth, yet growing, living, and becoming enriched in the process.

But perhaps because I'm正好 at the midpoint between 18 and 38, I feel both clear and迷茫. The film gently shatters a distorted future with武力 and physical training. We who live in reality cannot force ourselves to drink a瓶 of toxins to commit to the attainable pursuit of physical fitness. Yet, we haven't completely lost everything we cherished in our youth either, allowing us, alongside the film, to shed our shells and immerse ourselves in the warmth of everything Liu Lianzhi likes and represents.
