"title": "Clearing the Clouds to See the Sun"
"summary": "Taking a friend's birthday as an opportunity, the author reflects on nine years of friendship, from reduced contact after college without growing apart, to witnessing the friend experience comfort, betrayal, progress, and love. Through personal reflection and storytelling, the essay explores the complexity of life's path, arguing that life is not a simple choice of routes but a layered, easily disorienting vast directed graph. The author emphasizes the importance of practice and summarizing patterns in youth, ultimately using 'clearing the clouds to see the sun' as a metaphor for finding direction amid confusion. The core thesis is that life is full of confusion, but through time and experience, one can clear the clouds to see the sun and find their own way."

Hey, today is Little Zhang's birthday. Whenever such commemorative days come around, I can't help but reminisce: what was last year like on this day? And the year before that?

Of course, for it to be interesting and meaningful, all of this must be based on the commemorative significance this day holds for me. And for Little Zhang's birthday, that means from the moment I met him and started wanting to celebrate his birthday. Fortunately, we met early enough—these nine years are plenty for me to recall many things.

First, I want to sincerely wish him a happy birthday in this little corner he can't see. I hope my friend stays healthy and happy, isn't frightened by life's hardships, and walks firmly on his own path with a steady gaze. Reflecting on it, it seems our contact has gradually decreased since college, but it's not that we've grown apart. On the contrary, I believe our relationship hasn't been affected by distance. The greatness of university lies in its culture.

I've witnessed him hesitate due to comfort, grieve due to betrayal, move forward because of something on his mind, be loved because he is lovable, and ultimately, because of fate, I lost two friends and gained a couple who love to show off their affection in front of me.

People, we have few moments of smooth sailing and many moments of confusion. But looking back, the difficulties we once perceived were often just because our capacity wasn't big enough yet = =

**Haven't I been the same way?**

## Tell a Story

Language is a marvelous ability, allowing massive amounts of information to rapidly transfer between two individuals—definitely not a copy, but a leap, vanishing in one medium and reborn in another—embedding eternity in every fleeting moment through words, expressions, and every possible means.

What kind of process is this?

—Leaping up, piercing through dust and smoke, soaring past birds and beasts, leaving behind the dust, leaving behind the boulders, you who are reading these words finally arrive at—the moon?

Honestly, I don't know where you'll end up.

I used to think life was a network of interconnected roads. People choose their own paths, walking together if they share the same aspirations, parting ways if their ambitions differ.

Later, I realized it's not that simple. Life isn't a complete graph connecting all possible nodes, where you just choose a seemingly reasonable path and walk it. In fact, it's layered. So many roads, stretching into the distance, collapse into faint traces. In this intricate, vast directed graph, it's easy to lose your way.

Fortunately, being young enough gives one ample time to jump and weave through these edges, summarizing patterns, beliefs, and methodologies through practice.

We call this **clearing the clouds to see the sun.**
