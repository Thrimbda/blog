"title": "Bryan's Farewell"
"summary": "Using Bryan's disappearance as a thread, this article narrates the author's farewell to Bryan, a self-created emotional surrogate, and reflects on receiving an email after a roommate's abrupt departure. Through everyday scenes like the commute home and an electromagnetic door incident, it metaphorically explores inner experiences of freedom and loneliness. Ultimately, the author recognizes Bryan as a surrogate for escaping negative emotions, and his disappearance marks the author's evolution into a more authentic and composed person. A quote from Frank Lloyd Wright emphasizes how hypocrisy erodes creativity. Using skiing as a metaphor for life, the article stresses the importance of embracing the process."

On the last day of May, I realized Bryan was gone.

<!--more-->

There's no concrete evidence to prove Bryan's departure. We didn't need a farewell, so his leaving didn't have a precise moment either.

I became aware of this on my way home from work. That night, I was walking opposite Tsinghua University. Past ten o'clock, the bike shed was probably locked, so I decided to leave my bicycle at the office and follow my late-night routine: orange juice, music loud enough to drown out the street noise, and a touch of leisure. After about two hundred meters, passing the only spot on Tsinghua East Road where you can see the full moon, the thought crept into my mind—Bryan seemed to have left.

Going downstairs, I saw two people casually sitting cross-legged on the marble platform next to the stone lions at the building entrance, chatting, seemingly with drinks. I only dared a glance; a direct stare might be impolite, or perhaps they wouldn't care even if I stared. But at least, I had to cherish the rare image of these two people in my heart. What were they talking about? Was it about the present, the past, or the future? Was it a chance encounter or a long-awaited rendezvous? I had no way of knowing. I turned and walked into the convenience store, toasting them from afar with my orange juice.

Tsinghua East Road, from my observation, has a slight incline. Or, according to S, it's simply because the resistance to going to work makes the journey home feel easier. My attention shifted to the depths of my mind, pondering another farewell I never received, pondering the reason my roommate left without a word. We had discussed renewing the lease early on, and the conclusion was that he would move out. Unexpectedly, the morning I woke up, the roommate who had just played Plants vs. Zombies with me the night before had vanished, along with all traces of his life there. It's hard not to wonder if you did something wrong, to start imagining what he would do for a true friend. But from the premise of leaving without a word, I was clearly not a qualified friend, and that was deeply saddening.

Yet deep down, I couldn't ignore the major premise—we were indeed true friends. Because hearts aren't made of stone. Even someone as introverted as my roommate, always reserved for fear of causing trouble, could be moved by life. Those late-night discussions that started with technology and branched into technology itself, people, and the world; those interesting logical traps and puzzles: what is the contrapositive of "If you haven't been to the Great Wall, you're not a true man"; assuming we were machines and trying to reason from purely mechanical logic to see what interesting conclusions we'd reach—this often kept us, who had decided to sleep early, up until three or four in the morning, yet we never learned our lesson the next day. Or simple greetings, or walks. All these things at least fulfilled my own definition of friendship. While you can never truly know what another person is thinking, based on past experience, the other person would only engage in the behaviors I described if they shared similar thoughts.

**I thought, perhaps I would receive a letter, or a foreseeable final farewell.**

There was no uncertainty; I would wait for that letter forever.

At this point, I began to feel certain that Bryan, as an independent person, had completely vanished. I could find no trace of him in my mind.

Memories of Bryan also grew hazy. He always seemed to carry a certain melancholy, different from mine. His sadness was purer, without specific reasons. Perhaps he enjoyed this moon-like melancholy, savored the loneliness that simmered in his chest like a slow fire. Or maybe it was a ritual for him, cleansing his soul through sorrow.

Bryan's last story happened a few days ago when the electromagnetic door downstairs wouldn't open. He was holding a bag of trash, ready to go out and throw it away, then buy himself a bag of whole-grain bread from the bakery for dinner—I had been home all afternoon. Bryan repeatedly pressed the door switch—nothing. He pushed against the door with his body—still nothing, not even a loud sound, just a dull thud.

The logic is simple. For instance, if we have ample supplies, staying home for ten days or half a month without going out is no problem. But once we know the door is locked from the outside, the taste of freedom instantly becomes irresistibly tempting. At that point, staying home for even an hour becomes unbearable. Even if it meant jumping out a window, we'd want to get out—no negotiation. Bryan was the same. The thought of just eating something at home crossed his mind, but simply because the door was broken, he *had* to go out. **Going out became the sole reason, motivation, and purpose.** Dinner became less important.

So Bryan heard the crows cawing outside, feeling as if he had become one of them. He went to the stairwell between the first and second floors, opened the window leading to freedom. The window was small, only large enough for him to squeeze through curled up, but Bryan felt as happy as if he were flying. Reaching the second-floor platform, gripping the security bars, Bryan imagined himself a skilled explorer, extending his foot to find a foothold. The final step was stepping onto the building's mailbox unit, then jumping down, breathing in freedom as tangible as air. I took out my key, tentatively tried opening the door from the outside—it opened. Picking up the trash, I embarked on the quest for dinner.

That night, I witnessed such a magnificent sunset.

***

I finally received that email from my roommate—his apologies and gratitude. The entire message was proof of our friendship. After being roommates for 211 days, I was considered a warm person, a qualified friend. And after about a year of reflection and self-cultivation, along with recent signs, Bryan, the surrogate I used to escape my own negative emotions, has disappeared. The event years ago that gave birth to Bryan and long tormented me as Bryan ultimately helped me become a more authentic and composed person.

Frank Lloyd Wright's words can serve as the final verdict on the entire Bryan episode:

> Unconscious hypocrisy is terrible enough, but for any creative artist, conscious hypocrisy will more relentlessly erode his soul. No coward ever created a work of art—I once believed that, and still do today.

Finally, to summarize: previous writings mentioned that I couldn't see my own path clearly but wasted effort on trivial skills. Now I realize that whatever goals I have, all efforts are ultimately about becoming a better person—someone emotionally stable, clear-headed, self-aware, focused, and **abundant**. The conclusion from graduation still holds true:

> I anticipate that the life ahead will still be full of opportunities to make benign mistakes and moments of making none at all. The process won't be easy or pleasant, but it will be absolutely fascinating.

And life truly is like skiing: turn left, turn right, or think about it and die. We don't just have life; we are possessed by it.
