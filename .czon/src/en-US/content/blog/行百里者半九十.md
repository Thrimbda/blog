On the day I decided to take a Gap Year, I bought my first pack of cigarettes and six bottles of beer, halted everything I was working on, boarded a bus home, and prepared to spend an evening with myself.

The uncertainty of the future felt distant to me that day.

## The Ninety-Mile Traveler

To put it plainly, this was a long period of brewing, and because I suddenly came to my senses, it seemed unacceptable. Thinking of this, I felt the brevity of my life and envied the endless flow of the Yangtze River. In the end, I calmly swallowed it down along with the beef and beer, leaving only the bottommost line of the Qian hexagram I had seen many years ago in my mind: **First Nine: Hidden Dragon, Do Not Act**.

Looking back on my four years of confusion, I couldn’t see my own path. Starting over from scratch was almost routine, yet I still, in an almost cruel way, gave reasons for the path I had vaguely chosen long ago. Miraculously, I never strayed.

If I were to summarize, first I must explain a principle.

### A Syllogism

People never panic over what they lack and are unaware of. Fortunately, once knowledge is acquired, it can be said to be possessed. Therefore, to some extent, we are all satisfied with our current level of intelligence.

But we generally still progress. The beautiful expectations for future life drive a person to exert every effort to overcome the challenges of reality, sometimes even willingly seeking out trouble. We usually call this process exploration. Thus, our spiritual level gradually rises through hardship, and we never wish to return to the past.

Therefore, whether or not I reach the end, I am grateful for the ninety miles I have already walked.

As for a final judgment, it is impossible. The coffin is not yet closed; I still have many more hundred-mile journeys to walk. So, let the detailed stories remain in my diary.

For the remaining ten miles of this journey, I hope to summarize it with the second line of the Qian hexagram: **Second Nine: Dragon Appears in the Field. It is beneficial to see the great person.**

## The Halfway Point

In short, that night I talked all night with Master, who had always encouraged me, and finally felt at peace, convinced that I had chosen the path most suitable for myself. The next day, I spent a quiet and pleasant afternoon with my father, who had returned to Xi’an for a meeting. I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying time with my parents more and more.

Moving forward, I hope to continue exploring and never lose my curiosity.
