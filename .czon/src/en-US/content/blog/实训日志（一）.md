Well, today is the third day of the internship, and so far, it's quite different from what I had imagined.

I've complained before about the internet situation here: the dormitory has no internet at all, and the connection speed in the classroom is quite poor. This ordeal suddenly made me realize how addicted I am to the internet. However, I personally don't see this as a problem. The internet can indeed become a "Khala" that enlightens people's minds, ultimately elevating our entire species to a highly advanced...

Getting back on track, these past two days I've been learning the Spring framework, and it feels refreshingly new. As a newcomer, I couldn't help but marvel that Java code could also be so elegant.

Such an exclamation exposes how inexperienced I am. On second thought, any language can be elegant. Elegance is the crystallization of wisdom from meticulous thought and careful design; it doesn't seem to have much to do with the medium itself.

## RESTful

Currently, using the Spring framework is mainly for building web applications. Following the official tutorial, I also reviewed the benefits of RESTful architecture, which can be summarized as follows:

+ **Decoupling frontend and backend:** Since this architecture is resource-oriented, formatted text (often JSON?) rather than entire HTML pages serves as the Response. This allows for complete separation between frontend and backend.
+ **Clear representation:** RESTful makes full use of HTTP protocol features. It uses URIs to request resources instead of long QueryStrings separated by `&`. This embodies the design philosophy of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), not just treating it as a low-level transport protocol while messing around at the application layer. It strictly defines CRUD operations on resources and implements them using HTTP verbs.

I've only recently emerged from the mindset of ancient web development, so my understanding might not be very thorough yet. If there are any misconceptions, please don't hesitate to correct me!

## Spring as a Web Framework

It's been exactly one year from the major Java Web course project in my sophomore year until now. I've already encountered several web development technologies during this time. I can still recall the excitement when I first deployed an application to a server and successfully accessed it from my phone :) Having curiosity and following it to explore unknown territories is indeed a wonderful thing.

From Java's `JSP` to Python's `Django`, then to `Flask`, and finally back to Java, I met `Spring`.

JSP is a truly ancient technology. Using it is extremely cumbersome, especially during later development stages when modifying things back and forth for a specific feature. The entire Servlet can turn into a huge, lengthy monster. When JavaBeans involve database connections and require pagination, achieving elegance feels like an impossible dream. JSP pages, originally intended to demonstrate high reusability, become disfigured by various `<%if(...)%>` statements, to the point where I could write [code that made me question my own existence](./迷之代码.md). I should probably write another article specifically reflecting on these heinous sins I committed. Come to think of it, I don't even know how to write RESTful-style web services with JSP.

Things became much clearer with Python. Whether it's the powerful capabilities of `Django` or the simplicity and clarity of `Flask`, frameworks in general seem much more straightforward compared to the most foundational, pioneering technologies. If we categorize developers into tiers—the first being the creators of the technology, and the last being the users of applications (even if they are developers who just use things as-is)—I believe framework developers occupy the second tier. They summarize the development processes of commonly used technologies, extract the most frequent, fundamental, and essential parts, and package them into reusable components, thus creating an excellent framework. Precisely because of this, excellent frameworks are often stripped from real application projects. `Django` is like this, and so is `Spring`.

But ultimately, I feel `Spring` is more similar to `Flask`. They are both very lightweight and impose almost no restrictions. Perhaps the developers of `Flask` drew some inspiration from `Spring`.

### Interesting Aspects – Regarding the Symbol `@`

During my learning, I noticed that Spring's controller routing is implemented using Java's "annotation" syntax feature. I need to study this feature further. Coincidentally, `Flask` also uses a similar form, though in Python `@` is called a decorator—a syntactic sugar for wrapping functions. After browsing some materials, it seems this feature was indeed borrowed by Python from Java, but with more complex functionality in Python.

Therefore, as someone who already admired `Flask`, seeing this point made me instantly like `Spring` a lot more.

## Summary

In short, my current skill level is still far from adequate, so I haven't touched upon some of Spring's core features like IoC, DI, etc. But it has made me realize why Java, a language that seems old and weary, remains enduringly popular. It has also significantly increased my fondness for Java.

I look forward to learning more. It's really exciting.

Let's end with a classic log conclusion: "Today was truly a meaningful day."
