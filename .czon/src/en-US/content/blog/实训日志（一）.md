Well, today is the third day of the internship, and so far, it's quite different from what I had imagined.

I've complained before about the internet and its speed here: the dormitory has no internet at all, and the connection in the classroom is quite poor. This situation made me suddenly realize how addicted I am to the internet, though I personally don't see it as a problem. The internet can indeed become a "Kala" that enlightens people's minds, eventually elevating our entire species to a highly developed...

Getting back on track, these past two days I've been learning the Spring framework, and it feels refreshingly new. As a newcomer, I couldn't help but marvel that Java code could be so elegant.

<!--more-->

Such an exclamation reveals how inexperienced I am. On second thought, any language can be elegant. Elegance is the crystallization of carefully designed wisdom after thorough consideration, and it doesn't seem to have much to do with the medium.

## RESTful

Currently, using the Spring framework is mainly for building web applications. Following the official tutorial, I also reviewed the benefits of the RESTful architecture, which can be summarized as follows:

+ **Decoupling frontend and backend**: Since this architecture is resource-oriented, formatted text (often JSON?) rather than entire HTML pages is used as the Response, allowing complete separation of frontend and backend.
+ **Clarity of representation**: RESTful makes full use of HTTP protocol features. It uses URIs to request resources instead of long QueryStrings separated by `&`, reflecting the design philosophy of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) rather than just treating it as a low-level transport protocol with arbitrary upper-layer implementations. It strictly defines CRUD operations on resources and implements them using HTTP verbs.

I've only recently emerged from the ancient mindset of web development, so my understanding might not be very thorough yet. If there are any misconceptions, please don't hesitate to correct me!

## Spring as a Web Framework

It's been exactly one year from the major Java Web course project in my sophomore year until now. I've encountered several web development technologies during this time. I can still recall the excitement when I first deployed an application to a server and successfully accessed it from my phone :) Having curiosity and following it to explore unknown territories is indeed a wonderful thing.

From Java's `JSP` to Python's `Django`, then to `Flask`, and finally back to Java, I met `Spring`.

JSP is a truly ancient technology, and using it is so cumbersome, especially during later development stages when modifying things for a specific feature. The entire Servlet can become a huge, lengthy monster. And when JavaBeans involve database connections with pagination requirements, achieving elegance is almost a pipe dream. JSP pages, originally intended to demonstrate high reusability, can become unrecognizable due to various `<%if(...)%>` statements, to the point where I could write [code that made me question my own existence](./迷之代码.md). I should probably write a separate article reflecting on these heinous crimes I committed. By the way, I don't even know how to write RESTful-style web services with JSP.

Things became much clearer when I moved to Python. Whether it's the powerful capabilities of `Django` or the simplicity and clarity of `Flask`, frameworks in general seem much more straightforward compared to the most foundational, pioneering technologies. If we categorize developers into levels—the first being the creators of the technology, and the last being the users of applications (even if they are purely copy-paste developers)—I believe framework developers belong to the second level. They summarize the development processes of commonly used technologies, extract the most frequent, fundamental, and essential parts, and package them into reusable components, thus creating an excellent framework. For this reason, excellent frameworks are often stripped from real application projects, as is the case with both `Django` and `Spring`.

But ultimately, I think `Spring` is more similar to `Flask`. They are both very lightweight and impose almost no restrictions. Perhaps the developers of `Flask` drew some inspiration from `Spring`.

### An Interesting Point – About the Symbol `@`

During my learning, I noticed that Spring's controller routing is implemented using Java's "annotation" syntax feature. I need to study this feature further. Coincidentally, `Flask` uses a similar form, though in Python, `@` is called a decorator—a syntactic sugar for wrapping functions. After browsing some materials, it seems this feature was indeed borrowed by Python from Java but with more complex functionality.

Therefore, as someone who already admired `Flask`, seeing this similarity greatly increased my fondness for `Spring`.

## Summary

In conclusion, my current skill level is still quite lacking, so I haven't touched upon some of Spring's core features like IoC and DI. However, it has made me realize why Java, a language that seems aged, remains enduringly popular, and it has also significantly increased my appreciation for Java.

I look forward to learning more. It's really exciting.

Let me end with a classic log conclusion: "Today was truly a meaningful day."
