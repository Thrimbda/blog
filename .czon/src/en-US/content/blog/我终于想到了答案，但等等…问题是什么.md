"title": "I Finally Thought of the Answer, But Wait... What Was the Question?"
"summary": "This article documents the author's positive experience of accidentally sitting in the front row and actively listening to lectures after a long period of inattentiveness. In the courses 'Software System Analysis and Design' and 'Software Testing and Evaluation,' the author agreed with the teachers' points regarding system concepts, the importance of system design, the significance of requirements, and the necessity of signing contracts for projects. The article begins humorously by describing the common phenomenon of thinking of an answer but forgetting the question, using it to introduce reflections on the lectures. It concludes with the author forgetting the intended topic, expressing a sense of helplessness and sadness."

The title describes a phenomenon that sounds a bit silly but is actually quite common—at least for me, ~~and surely for you too.~~

This post was inspired by a moment of deep engagement during today's lectures, which were probably the most comfortable classes I've attended in a year.

## About Attending Lectures

I haven't paid attention in class for over a year, mainly because I sleep too late, get too tired during lectures, and eventually just gave up. But today, on a whim, I decided to sit in the front row and listen. Surprisingly, it felt great.

## Reflections

I'm not sure if it's because I've accumulated a bit of experience lately or for some other reason, but I found that both teachers in 'Software System Analysis and Design' and 'Software Testing and Evaluation' mentioned some points I strongly agree with. It's like learning the hard way and then coming back to fix things.

+ The concept of a system
+ The importance of system design
+ The importance of requirements
+ Projects must have a contract signed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Alright, I don't want to write anymore because I've forgotten the question I wanted to discuss.

Sad.
