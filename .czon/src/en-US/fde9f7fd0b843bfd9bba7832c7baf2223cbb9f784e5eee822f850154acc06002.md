"title": "Little Paw Prints on the Curtain"
"summary": "This article begins with the author returning to Suzhou and discovering cat paw prints on the curtain, leading to reflections on the passage of time and life experiences. The core of the article revolves around two things learned from the autobiography of architect Frank Lloyd Wright: style and taste. The author explores how the formation of style requires time and a solid foundation, eventually emerging naturally; taste involves the ability to appreciate artworks, cultivated through life experience and training. Examples such as Van Gogh, Keats, and Beethoven, as well as the plot of the play *Copenhagen*, illustrate how taste can transcend time and space to touch the human heart. Finally, the author compares style and taste to 'apply' and 'eval,' emphasizing their role in constructing a rich life, and concludes with the imagery of the cat paw prints, echoing the preservation of emotions and memories."

A while ago, I returned to Suzhou. Grape didn’t come back with me. As I turned off the lights and prepared to sleep, I noticed several deep little paw prints on the curtain. I couldn’t hold back any longer. In the middle of the night, I got out of bed and pondered the long weeks Grape had spent alone at home—time, and the things that flow with it, shaping my life.

In a previous article, we discussed the shape of time, its power, its playfulness and mockery. One point deserves special emphasis: the speed at which time passes varies depending on a person’s state. The Boss and I have observed that lately, it seems to be accelerating exponentially—so much so that half of this year feels like it passed in an instant. Yet, upon closer reflection, it seems last year was the same. I always think it hasn’t been long since I last wrote, but over a year has already passed.

Though this year has been fast, it has also been abundant. Beyond abundance, it has carried the breath of life and the witnessing of life itself.

And all of this truly began over a year ago, in the days before time started accelerating, with a book—an architect who wrote himself into its pages.

***

On February 11 of that year, daidai sent me a picture of a book cover that read: `An Autobiography: Frank Lloyd Wright`.

“You’ll like it.”

And so, this architect, who despised sentimentality yet was profoundly sensitive and rich, came to life in my mind.

By revisiting his life, he taught me two important things for witnessing this world:

The first is **style**. The formation of style requires time to catalyze. First, we must solidly master the basics, reaching a state where we act freely without overstepping boundaries. Take riding a bicycle as an analogy: eventually, you don’t need your hands to steer; you use your body, or your heart. If you think about riding over the solid line on the bike lane, you won’t deviate. Once the foundation is laid, it becomes a process of specific creation—facing a problem domain, raising the questions that trouble us along the critical path, and then using the foundation we’ve built to solve problems or express emotions.

**At the moment we put the finishing touches, style quietly arrives. What remains is to welcome and appreciate it—a moment of joy.**

What is style? It’s like the tangible colors of the objective world. Take Van Gogh’s paintings, for example. He exaggerated certain phenomena in the world, sparing no ink, and in some parts, his strokes could be described as quite rough, creating a strong sense of distinctiveness. This distinctiveness is the embodiment of style. Yet, everyone appreciates this beauty in different ways—or may not find it beautiful at all. Is the understanding of style entirely subjective?

What is good style? This leads to the second important thing the architect discussed: **taste**. Who possesses such good taste that they can appreciate a specific artwork and savor the style that leaps from it?

Like the cypress trees and starry nights in Van Gogh’s brushstrokes; the haunting song of the nightingale in Keats’ poetry; Beethoven’s poetic, vibrant Sixth Symphony. These universally acclaimed works are each unique, yet they all possess a solid, graceful power that transcends time and space, breaks through the barriers of the human heart, instills conviction, gives meaning, and lends coherence to life.

However, appreciating these works undoubtedly requires a certain degree of training. Take “Ode on Melancholy” as an example: `Aye, in the very temple of delight, Veil’d Melancholy has her sovran shrine`. When I first read it, I was at an age where I had just gained adult sensibilities but was still inexperienced in the world. I only felt the meaning of this line was obscure. As I learned about Keats’ life and began to pay homage to the shrine of melancholy in my own life, it started to grow in my heart in a unique way.

Or take drama as an example: `“Why did Heisenberg return to Copenhagen in 1941?”` Why did that brief meeting at Bohr’s home in Copenhagen end Heisenberg and Bohr’s twenty-year friendship? This question, which has lingered in the public mind for over half a century, serves as the clue in the play *Copenhagen*, forming the background and foundational framework of the entire drama. In reality, it cleverly illustrates how complex the human heart can be. Behind a single decision or action collapsed into reality, there may be dozens or even hundreds of motives in a state of superposition.

Heisenberg was an old friend of the Bohr family and also a German who shared the burden of war crimes. He was like Bohr’s most outstanding son, yet he also bore the roles of husband and father. His motives were even more numerous than his identities: Did Heisenberg want to prevent the birth of nuclear weapons? Did he want to shoulder the responsibility of reviving German science? Was it because Heisenberg had become Germany’s youngest professor? Or was he simply a homesick child? Or perhaps Heisenberg himself didn’t even know why he came? This state of confusion and chaos expanded exponentially like a chain reaction, ultimately saving all the cities that were not bombed with nuclear weapons by Axis Germany. Humanity! A collection of contradictions!

In the summer of 2018, Little Lion took me to see this play at Peking University. Since then, it has lingered in my heart, growing richer with each revisit. This is perhaps the process of building taste: first, it enters my memory, and as life unfolds, scenes from the play are reenacted in reality in various yet interconnected ways, allowing me to appreciate it further. At the same time, it guides my real life, teaching me to equally respect the dozens of motives behind others’ decisions.

So, what is taste?

You could say taste is entirely dogmatic—a logically self-consistent virtual system that builds bridges between people’s hearts, with destinations entirely unrestricted. You could also say taste should be objective, transcending personal likes and dislikes, merely a reflection of the real world in the human heart.

The architect didn’t provide an answer; he simply assumed taste exists. Whether dogmatic or an objective existence, it is contradictory yet unified. It must reflect some attribute of reality, rarely contradicting it, yet not stopping at reality or mechanical materialism. It guides human rationality and aesthetics, constructing civilization atop the real environment. These rich works provide me with raw materials, like poetry. At first encounter, they may not be understood, but with frequent reflection and resonance, they form my taste.

Style and taste are like `apply` and `eval`, following the way of nature, constructing the architect’s tumultuous yet abundant life.

*Every time I open that autobiography, no matter my mood, I eventually return to a harmonious tranquility. How should a person live their life? I hope to live as abundantly as the architect.*

When I read about Frank’s final decision to join Sullivan’s firm and bid farewell to his former boss, he described it in his autobiography like this:

![Pain](https://0xc1.space/images/2020/09/13/pain.jpg)

This scene lingered in my memory for a long time. It wasn’t until I had a similar experience that I realized all the preparations were useless—the pain came unexpectedly. Just like the little paw prints on the curtain, Grape, in the days and nights I was away, walked to the bay window countless times, scratching the curtain with her little paws, earnestly hoping that the moment she scratched, I would appear behind the curtain to respond. She scratched and scratched, and her claws, sharp from not being trimmed for too long, caught on the curtain, leaving behind those little paw prints.
