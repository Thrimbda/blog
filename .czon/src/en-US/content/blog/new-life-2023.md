# About the New Life

- Death Stranding, the connections between people
- The principal contradiction
- Love in the Time of Cholera
- Must remember: writing this essay now is also forcing myself to organize my thoughts to face the future
- Summarizing and looking ahead, accompanying my journey to view apartments
- Loss of Control & Gaining Control
- Clumsiness -> means more practice is needed.

## Part One
On the subway last Sunday, on my way to view an apartment, I sat in a corner seat, hand covering my bowed head, feeling utterly miserable, like a stray dog.

This was the first time I truly felt the sense of parting.

## Too Perfect
This feeling of imperfection is not unfamiliar. What is imperfect is my restless heart, which is why I have always been searching, exploring, and experiencing—it has been a significant driving force in my life's journey.

For nearly the past four years, there was no imperfection, only a sense of contentment, laziness, and indulgence.

Perfection, or completeness, is not about being flawless in every way. I'd like to reinterpret the meaning of this word: people experience joy and sorrow, parting and reunion; the moon waxes and wanes. The combination of all these phases is what constitutes reality. I don't believe everything **should** be perfect. If there were only perfection, it would become utterly meaningless.

Apart from work, my life had gradually stagnated over this period. We spent less and less time nurturing it. Specifically, chopsticks would be left to mold in the sink with no one having the heart to clean up. Our lives seemed to be dampened and drained of vitality within some medium, like water.

To put it bluntly, certain aspects of life were gradually withering away. This is the only thing I'm certain of right now. As for the rest of the problems, I have no idea. Being in the mountains, I only see jagged rocks, tangled roots, and unpredictable weather, while the mountain itself remains invisible.

I also don't know where this suffocating feeling comes from. Did we fail to manage things well? Was the passion bound to fade? Or were we simply not prepared? I don't know. Actually, I know it's a bit of all these things.

## Part Two
Actually, the night before, I had contacted a Ziroom agent and arranged to view apartments near Songjiang University Town around 2:30 PM on Sunday. Songjiang is too far from Yangpu—nearly a two-hour trip. The reason we didn't stick to the plan wasn't just oversleeping; we also watched some TV together at noon and didn't leave until 1:30 PM. So, I informed the agent in advance that we'd reschedule, but I still set out to get a haircut.

Excessive gloom on the road isn't good for mental health. A sudden, large dose of unfamiliar environments can easily trigger a stress response. Plus, since it was on the way, I spontaneously decided to visit my familiar barber for a haircut.

## Loss of Control
A person is a container, but the heart desires things beyond its capacity. When it can't hold them, that's loss of control. What does that feeling taste like?

Clumsiness. The thought of clumsily picking up a solitary life for the coming period gives me a headache. I was once familiar with such a life and handled it with ease. However, after four years of neglect and lack of practice, I'm no longer accustomed to it. The result is clumsiness—so clumsy that I don't even know where to begin writing this essay.

Fear. Fear that my occasionally anxious heart will feel lost, restless, even silently screaming in the dim room after a nap, then be filled with a sense of emptiness, rendering me unable to do anything until I start regretting having accomplished nothing all day.

The feeling of losing control is painful, but ultimately, it's not unfamiliar. It's similar to the feeling when you write a TODO item at work that you have no idea how to implement. In most cases, as you gradually understand the matter better, solutions emerge. A sense of control gradually eats away at the feeling of being out of control, and your heart settles down considerably.

Mencius said: "If you seek, you will get it; if you give up, you will lose it. This seeking is beneficial for attainment because what is sought lies within me. There is a way to seek it, but whether you attain it is a matter of fate. This seeking is not beneficial for attainment because what is sought lies outside."

The more I ponder this, the more profound it seems: Some things can be obtained simply through effort—straightforward, with so few variables affecting them, brimming with order. Other things have a method for seeking them, but no guarantee of attainment. Between seeking and attaining lie countless variables, even inexplicable ones—a realm of pure chaos.

Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat all things as straw dogs. The universe bears no malice toward humans. In such an objective world, people need to manage their relationship with their own hearts, expanding their capacity as human beings amidst widespread loss of control. To avoid sinking into chaos in this process, one must actively seek a sense of control. To summarize abstractly: I need to deliberately plunge into the abyss of chaos while simultaneously creating countless small universes brimming with order within that chaos.

Such is life. Work has actually been this way for a long time.

Regret the past that cannot be changed, know that the future can still be pursued. We will all embark on new life journeys, and time will allow the seeds we plant to grow.

## Part Three
It had been too long since my last visit. Barber Jiawen and his team had moved to a new shop in Jiuting. Finally seeing a familiar face was truly a joy. My hair, grown out for over half a year, was also happy—it was finally going to look more put-together.

Jiawen poured me a glass of water, surprised that I had started to look like a wild man. He then gave me a haircut resembling Oguri Shun's style. However, having gained a few pounds, I ended up looking more like Gao Xiaosong. I must lose weight.

## Part Three Point Five
The feeling of losing control also comes from work.

## Part Four
I still insisted on meeting a few Lianjia agents to view apartments. Songjiang was much better than I had imagined—the infrastructure was good, it didn't seem overly noisy, and the rent was considerably cheaper than in the city center.

After viewing the apartments, I had a meal at a Shaanxi noodle restaurant with CZ. What was disheartening about this day was the feeling of losing control, but partially familiar things and expectations for the future caught me. Perhaps it's like the saying: "Leaping in the abyss, no blame."

## Future Plans

Not finished, to be continued.
