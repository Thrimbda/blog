Just a few farewell dinners, a few items left to collect, and a few more days, and I will truly graduate, leaving the sweet dreamland to once again set foot on the soil of reality.

Just now, I was chatting with the head class monitor. We both knew in our hearts that this was probably the last chat before graduation. We talked about nothing but future prospects, ending with a phrase like a secret code. I sent it out, and he sent it back: **Be a light to the world**.

It comes from the Xi'an Jiaotong University anthem.

> How splendid is our school, the flower of truth, a model for youth, the glory of the nation,
>
> The school flag flutters, growing with the sun, be a light to the world, be a light to the world.
>
> How splendid is our school, inspiring the masses, enlightening our wisdom, igniting our passion,
>
> Talented scholars gather, venturing far and wide, be a light to the world, be a light to the world.
>
>
>
> How splendid is our school, the source of spirit, the profound mansion of science, the forest garden of art,
>
> Industry expands, progress knows no bounds, be a light to the world, be a light to the world.
>
> How splendid is our school, with brilliant civilization, practical learning cultivates the nation's foundation, the nation achieves revival,
>
> Vast is the universe, high the mountains and long the rivers, be a light to the world, be a light to the world.

Graduation is imminent. Many things and many people cannot be dealt with or bid farewell to in time. I am about to be swept away by the torrent of the times, either dashed against the broader shores of fate or riding the wind and waves, forging ahead, becoming a navigator of the era. Not to mention the overused but beautiful phrase: "Our journey is to the stars and the sea." Ambition and lofty aspirations always exist, especially at this time—the time of parting, the time of ending, the season of new beginnings. This feeling, I think, can only be expressed by this phrase from the anthem of my alma mater, which I both love and resent and am about to leave: "Be a light to the world."

~~I've finally graduated, so I can freely use the term 'alma mater.'~~

### Coming to Jiao Da After Failing the Exam?

I don't know which senior I heard it from: "People at Xi'an Jiaotong University all have a sense of resentment, even to the point of 'coming to Jiao Da after failing the college entrance exam.'" This impression was very profound for me when I first entered the university campus four years ago: even before the semester started, I glimpsed the depression of failing the Peking University exam from a new classmate's QQ space, the original words being "**living towards death**." This sentiment was especially evident in student unions and clubs—everyone was unhappy, feeling they had been shortchanged by coming here; a future "roommate" also confided in me during a night chat that he felt like a stray dog, his plans disrupted, dreams shattered, disgracing his teachers!

Narrowing it down to my major: the air was even more permeated with a sense of despair. Due to low admission scores, this major became a good place to transfer students, and all freshmen had the opportunity to switch into it without cost when registering at the school, to attract students. **It seemed very cheap, a major even ghosts would disdain; how could those who came not disdain themselves?** During military training, leaders from the neighboring School of Electronic and Information Engineering came to greet us. Out of 3,500 freshmen on the track field, 800 stood up, crowding a corner of the field, creating a spectacular scene for a while. The School of Software, however, had only one department, Software Engineering. When leaders came, only a sparse eighty or so people were there, desolate and lonely. But I was naive and didn't think about these things at the time; instead, I took the opportunity to observe the girls I had never seen before.

The above mindset is a major commonality among students at Jiao Da and in the Software Engineering program. I might be an exception because my classmates and I all got into university based on our own abilities. Why could you fail based on your abilities, while I couldn't exceed expectations and joyfully come to the university campus without any feeling of unworthiness? But I could still feel my classmates' disappointment, and I was clearly affected. Fortunately, this mindset lasted at most a year for most people. Once we became familiar with our new base, built new friendships, and even licked our wounds enough to win back new dreams, the past disappointments and regrets became insignificant. Only then did we begin to vaguely realize the **new mission and vision** we possessed, truly as the anthem says, we should "be a light to the world."

### The Cradle of Engineers

During freshman year, the teacher teaching Computer Fundamentals joked that our school was the "cradle of engineers," meaning it only cultivates engineers but not leaders, becoming the backbone of society but mostly buried in the torrent, serving as a solid foundation for the superstructure. He commented on the school motto: "**Diligent in Study, Sincere in Ambition, Resolute in Action, and Faithful in Duty**." It seemed to me he had bitterness he couldn't fully express, both admirable and frustrating. I couldn't say I disagreed, yet I sighed that students weren't taught to have lofty ambitions.

It actually fits my own characteristics quite well: **unsuited to be a leader, yet unwilling to be a follower, but can be considered an observer**. I'm not stupid, but each of the four points in the motto is something I lack and need to learn. As for the rest, principles and applications need to be savored in the details of life, not hindering moving forward. Additionally, I have a strange ability—to inadvertently say what I most want to say and do what I truly want to do. Sometimes, this stumbling around can lead to painful bumps, but after pruning the dead branches and withered leaves, one really becomes more spirited.

So, under the influence of the resentment described earlier, and through my own unintentional yet sincere choices, I moved forward with unsteady steps. Various events in life strung together make one feel afterward that those coincidences and critical moments were simply incredible; if I were to attend university a second time, it would be entirely different. These events include suddenly deciding at 4 AM the night before the election for department head to abandon the student union, feeling I should contribute to the Microsoft Student Club family I loved, staying for four years; later, after eating lunch at Wutong Yuan, seeing the long-admired robotics team setting up a booth and happily walking up to sign up, spending a whole year with "signing in at the team except during class time, Friday afternoons, and a ten-day holiday during New Year," which boosted my overall technical sense and confidence; signing up for the Microsoft Student Summer Camp during the sophomore summer break on a whim, meeting a respectable friend who, as a casual favor before graduation, helped arrange my current placement; interning at a lab, gaining a unique early experience of graduate student life at our school and firmly deciding not to pursue postgraduate studies; during the lab internship, taking on a freelance project that later left me so discouraged. Please note the times mentioned below are in the past perfect tense:

> Last September, because I was short on money, I took on a freelance website project, scheduled to go live at the end of October. Little did I know it would become a veritable `tar pit` that I couldn't complete in a whole semester. Hence, this **mythical man-month** tale, serving as a lesson for not humbly learning from predecessors' earnest teachings and valuable experience, being self-righteous, ending up in a sorry state, and only understanding the principles after writing ugly code. I also hope to use this as a summary of my personal learning life, trying to extract some insights, ultimately raising my own level a bit.

And finally, the half-year I had planned for but still caught off guard, hurriedly learning from scratch, yet making a sharp turn at the critical moment to go abroad for further study [matter](http://0xc1.space/2017/12/10/%E8%A1%8C%E7%99%BE%E9%87%8C%E8%80%85%E5%8D%8A%E4%B9%9D%E5%8D%81/). I ended up sitting on my bed, writing this essay with great relish.

**The eagerness of the first year, the arduous accumulation of the second year, the happiness and helplessness of the third year, the confusion and calmness of the fourth year—this is the blood and fire in this cradle for me.**

Therefore, I didn't feel discouraged about being trained as an engineer. Doesn't Google in the West also advocate "Ask the engineer"? During the alma mater's 120th anniversary the year before last, I asked myself, "Can I be a light to the world?" A candid friend said: "Just a code farmer."

I only hope to be the kind of code farmer who cannot be easily replaced, **nurturing immortal logical fruits from the fields of thought**.

### Remembering the Source

An anecdote once happened on campus: two men fought in a classroom, prompting a boy in red in the class to slam the table and stand up: "This is Xi'an Jiaotong University, a world-class institution, and you are here making a scene. Do you think it's appropriate?!" It caused a sensation across the campus at the time, and a wave of thought followed...

I also think of an article that flooded my WeChat Moments during the anniversary days: "Jiaotong University ≠ Shanghai Jiaotong University." There seem to be five Jiaotong Universities nationwide with the same root: Shanghai Jiaotong University, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Southwest Jiaotong University, Beijing (Northern) Jiaotong University, and National Chiao Tung University (Hsinchu). Among them, Shanghai Jiaotong University and Xi'an Jiaotong University are most closely related, originating from the Nanyang Public School founded by the Beiyang Government in 1896. The Nanyang Public School was renamed several times, becoming Jiaotong University, then National Chiao Tung University. Finally, on its 60th anniversary, the main part of the university relocated west, moving to the vast northwest to support development and construction, growing into Xi'an Jiaotong University. The part that remained in Shanghai operated independently for three more years, becoming today's Shanghai Jiaotong University. Due to various factors, Shanghai Jiaotong University has brought great honor and is the leader among the five sibling universities. Thus, the resounding name "Jiaotong University" has silently been equated with Shanghai Jiaotong University in the minds of scholars and the public at home and abroad. This, in turn, ignited the self-esteem of XJTU students already affected by the "coming to Jiao Da after failing the exam" mentality, leading them to speak up for their beloved alma mater. Even the fact that former President Jiang later only visited SJTU and not XJTU caused resentment. I share this sentiment too. A few days ago, a senior from another school saw my photo with former President Jiang and exclaimed, "President Jiang is also from Jiao Da?" thinking he had misspoken, and corrected himself: "XJTU, not Jiao Da." I stuck out my tongue at the screen.

Interestingly, all five Jiaotong Universities have an almost identical "Remembering the Source" monument, with a three-dimensional school emblem on top and the characters "饮水思源" (Remembering the Source) engraved on it. Once we truly enter the real battlefield, as long as we hear someone is a fellow student or senior from Jiaotong University, we feel a special kinship. Some even go so far as to truly implement the idea that it's Jiaotong University regardless of XJTU or SJTU, so they go to SJTU for graduate studies. **After the jokes, heroes are not asked about their origins; everyone relies on their own abilities to get things done. Loving one's school is another matter of emotion; we just need to remember to remember the source.**

## Beautiful Dream, Reality

> Giving this title might make it seem like I'm indulging in fantasy while ignoring reality, but that's both true and not.

As mentioned at the beginning of this article: "**leaving the sweet dreamland to once again set foot on the soil of [reality](http://0xc1.space/2018/03/08/'Tis-not-through-envy-of-thy-happy-lot/).**" Since going to Beijing for an internship in mid-January this year, I realized the preciousness of campus life. I once inwardly shouted, "Why don't I just go back to school and be a couch potato before graduation?!" **In reality, internship life is very novel, interesting, makes one full of drive, and offers chances to suddenly realize it's already 11 PM.** What I want to say is that campus life is like a beautiful dream. Every time I return to school, it's like continuing this sweet slumber.

So, in early March, I played games until 4 AM; in early April, I slept soundly until noon, then ordered a box of roast duck rice, hung around the college for the afternoon, went to Kangqiao for dinner, took a bath at the hot spring bathhouse, and bought lemon black tea at the small shop; in early May, I added buying rolled pancakes, tofu, cold dishes, and gluten at the southeast gate in the evening—we called it the "top of the taste"—to spend a "typical day" for myself at school. Even sweating on some staircase on campus felt incredibly blissful, like returning home after an eternity in a secluded land to find everything unchanged.

However, on the high-speed train back to school for my thesis defense in June, my heart was surprisingly calm. It was as if I had slept a long, beautiful sleep, sunlight shining on the quilt, the sleepiness not yet fully dissipated, body and mind rested, floating up from the depths of the sea of sleep, opening my eyes, serene and satisfied. Though beautiful, the dream was ultimately a deep sleep dream, where I only had eyes and ears to learn and listen. Now awake, I have the strength to act. Qian, the Creative, with its four virtues; the first line changes to the second and third lines; the hidden dragon emerges from the water. It's time to seek out the great person and then be vigilant day and night, cautious morning and evening.

The novelty of the first two years of university wasn't fully savored before the latter two years flew by like a rocket. I told many of these stories to my diary, and more I didn't tell it because I was lazy. But the original, undisturbed environment gave me many opportunities to make benign mistakes that wouldn't knock me out of the game and to learn knowledge about not making mistakes, identifying those malignant mistakes that, once made, would knock me out with no chance for remedy. The process of making mistakes and the taste of their consequences are the most unpleasant, allowing me to deepen my impression, lick my wounds, and learn from them. In the play *Copenhagen*, Heisenberg says: "Left, right, or think about it and die." I deeply agreed and posted it on my Moments to warn myself. But upon careful reflection, I realized the context this sentence applies to is skiing. In such a tense and exciting sport, one can only turn left or right based on muscle memory formed from previous falls. If one thinks at that moment, they'll miss the timing, perish, and be ruled out by fate. The key is to **constantly think, constantly fall, constantly form new muscle memory** in a gentler environment, so that one can agilely and cleverly turn left or right in truly perilous environments and enjoy the thrill and joy brought by extreme sports in the process.

I foresee that the life ahead will still be full of opportunities to make benign mistakes and moments of making no mistakes at all. The process won't be easy or pleasant, but it will be absolutely fascinating.
