"title": "The One Who Envies Time"
"summary": "This article explores the nonlinear nature of time through Bryan's perspective, arguing that time is not a flat line but a complex, interconnected web. It delves into how the human heart is encoded and transmitted through language, and how time's projection onto the heart evokes emotions like curiosity and inferiority. Bryan envies the marks time leaves on others but ultimately resolves to face it bravely, learning to distinguish between what changes and what remains constant in time, and believing that time will enrich him. The article also discusses time's role in shaping the consistency of the human heart, the relative shifts between joy and melancholy, and emphasizes the importance of balance and self-loyalty."

“Drink! Plasma Egg, it is the fate of your kind!” Bryan, having just finished his shower and refilled the water for the red bowl on the floor, spoke with a vigorous, resonant tone.

Plasma Egg and Bryan do not share a common language. In fact, between the two of them, only one can speak. Though it may sound a bit far-fetched, what Bryan said was at least true—who doesn’t need water?

## Time Is Not a Flat Line

> Time was later proven not to be one-dimensional as people once thought. Or rather, describing it as merely "one-dimensional" is insufficient to capture its intricate, web-like structure.

If this secret were made public, everyone would think Bryan had gone mad.

But once the taste of truth is savored, it becomes irresistible. Even if kept as a secret locked away in his heart, never to be shared with another human, enduring immense loneliness, Bryan would still follow his curiosity and continue seeking evidence. After all, this truth was born in his mind, in his memories—more precisely, it emerged from another unspeakable secret in his heart. That was a terrifying [thought experiment](https://0xc1.space/2018/08/13/Sleeping%20to%20dream/) that left Bryan in a state of fear for six months and forty days.

### The Human Heart

Yet, phenomena related to time are also connected to the human heart. As is well known, people imprison themselves (whether intentionally or unintentionally), keeping their hearts forever hidden from the light of day. Observing another’s heart is even more impossible. We can only rely on language to project our hearts—rich, complex, and multifaceted—onto a straight line and hand it over to another person, praying that their genius can restore our hearts, which have been distorted by linearity.

However, there are moments when our hearts inadvertently flicker into someone else’s, or vice versa. At such times, expressions appear on people’s faces—most often smiles, sometimes bittersweet happiness. Because the heart is confined within a prison of its own design or making, the most cruel emotions are curiosity and shyness. Bryan knows all too well the pain of being curious about another’s heart. Whether in sunshine or rain, one can only guess based on meager evidence. And shyness only deepens the pain brought by curiosity.

### Encoding the Human Heart into Language

Fortunately, most of the time, things are not about pain.

Bryan sometimes tries to explain his understanding of time to others. For instance, the process by which the human heart constructs another’s heart through language is not, as most people imagine, an isolated point existing solely on a timeline. Sometimes, a person’s words can suddenly take effect years later, like finally obtaining the key to a puzzle. Thus, language, combined with the workings of time, moves freely through the world. Since humans cannot foresee the future, it is difficult to perceive this effect. Even if they do, they can never describe it to another—the equation has already been filled with too many unknowns.

For those who have long spoken a particular language, they sometimes use the same, not necessarily correct, pattern to construct and interpret the hearts hidden within language. If they suddenly switch to another language, unfamiliarity with the language itself makes them instinctively cautious, allowing the language to connect more directly to the heart. Bryan has a foreign friend with whom he once shared a campfire. Their conversations often make Bryan aware of this. However, compared to the role of language itself, the similarity of human hearts is the solid foundation of friendship.

### Time’s Projection onto the Human Heart

It is precisely because of this unknowability of the future, the grasp and memory of the past, and the different positions within the web of time that immense differences and similarities arise between people. **Thus, Bryan envies time, or rather, the marks time leaves on a person.** This envy is actually composed of two distinct emotions:

The first is the aforementioned curiosity—curiosity about how many linguistic riddles this person has solved in different times, curiosity about the blessings and reproaches time has bestowed upon another heart, making it exuberant. Curiosity about whether he, using the same time as a measure, can experience the suffering and joy of another heart and whether he, too, can become exuberant.

This leads to the second emotion: a deep sense of inferiority. Broadly speaking, lacking the effects of time means lacking countless keys—unable to unlock the secrets hidden in the language left by those before, and unable to powerfully form new words and construct new language to encode his heart in new forms. Narrowly speaking, due to the asynchronicity of time, the probability of influencing another heart through non-linguistic means is greatly reduced. Bryan asks himself if he is laughably naive. Even now, I can understand a bit of this feeling of his.

In the end, Bryan decides not to be a coward. He begins to learn to distinguish between what changes and what remains constant in time, believing that time will ultimately make him exuberant as well.

### Time’s Effect on the Human Heart

In the face of impartial time, relative effects begin to show their power: “Hidden melancholy has her supreme shrine.” This is almost the line of poetry Bryan has pondered the longest. As time passes, more and more keys become available to unlock parts of its mystery, allowing him to savor different nuances.

Bryan discovers that persistently tasting melancholy amidst joy is a manifestation of consistency. Because only within the same frame of reference does the latter emerge from longing for the former. In a book Bryan recently read, this consistency spanned an astonishing fifty-three years.

However, consistency is ultimately a precious quality. More often, as time flows, the human heart changes. Simplified to the binary relative effects we speak of, this manifests as joy becoming平淡 (flat) as it increases, while melancholy diminishes over time. The most tragic scenario is when past joy turns into pain, and past melancholy loses all meaning. Bryan calls this change betrayal.

He will never allow such betrayal of himself to happen again. But as long as the rhythm is appropriate, balance will naturally emerge, just like the eyes of a poplar tree when seen for the first time—those eyes, big and small! Without an exuberant heart, they are hard to see.

### Time Ends in Plasma Egg’s Snoring

So, what are the things that change in time, and what are the things that remain constant? If a once-deep friendship now seems insignificant, can it be said that the hearts that existed in that time have died?

Or perhaps every person is reborn each day, carrying the memories of yesterday’s heart, ~~using this discovery as a grand excuse for procrastination~~.

Plasma Egg ultimately accepts her fate and begins to snore peacefully. Only then does Bryan realize that time has stopped.
