"summary": "This article uses the concept of Bus Factor mentioned by Henrik Lissner, the author of doom-emacs, as a starting point to explore the fragility of open source software, such as the Faker.js incident. Through Bourdieu's field theory, it analyzes the transformation of the open source spirit from hacker culture's gift economy to commercialization. The article points out that open source software has bifurcated into utopian projects (like Linux) and commercially driven projects (like MongoDB), forming various business models. The author argues that open source embracing capital is historically inevitable, fostering more robust infrastructure and enabling the industry to progress through community collaboration rather than relying on individual heroes."

## Prologue - The Fragility (?) of Open Source Software

Recently, Henrik Lissner, the author of doom-emacs, after being absent for nearly half a year, spoke up in the doom-emacs Discord channel:

The gist is:

> Hello everyone! I've been away from this project and community for about a month, dealing with family issues. If you count the health, internet, and moving problems I encountered last year, it's been even longer. Worse, I didn't inform you about these things in a timely manner (or give advance warning), and I want to apologize for that. Combined with several failed attempts over the past few months, I've started to make people worry about Doom's future and its Bus Factor.
>
> To be clear: I have no intention of abandoning Doom—this has just been an unfortunate and distracting two years for me—and I hope it's over now.
>
> After spending a week catching up, merging PRs, and updating modules, I'll post a more detailed announcement on Discourse outlining the current situation, the project's direction, and how I plan to address the bus factor and communication issues in the future.
>
> In the meantime, you can find me in the #development channel; if you have any questions about the project, have recently sent me a private message/email (and are expecting a reply), or have any PRs ready to merge or needing my attention, feel free to reach out there.

Setting aside for a moment what doom-emacs is, Henrik mentioned a very interesting term: **Bus Factor**.

Wikipedia explains this term as:

Bus Factor is a metric in software development that measures the concentration of knowledge and capabilities among project members, also known as "truck factor" or "lorry factor." It refers to the number of key members whose sudden absence ("hit by a bus," referring to career changes, lifestyle shifts, marriage, childbirth, accidents, or any reason for absence) would cause the project to fall into chaos, paralysis, and ultimately fail to continue. These members are considered "indispensable to the project," meaning the knowledge they possess (e.g., design, source code, expertise) is not widely shared or understood by others. In a project with a high bus factor, even if someone suddenly leaves, many others would have sufficient knowledge to take over their role.

A low Bus Factor is actually a common issue in many open source projects. If you frequently browse GitHub, you'll likely notice many projects with high star counts being abandoned due to lack of maintenance.

The most extreme example occurred in early 2022 when Marak, the author of the well-known open source tool Faker.js, intentionally sabotaged the repository on GitHub. He cleared all the project code and left the word "endgame" in the commit message. That day, front-end engineers worldwide were confused to find their projects malfunctioning and displaying large chunks of garbled code.

Additionally, another library he developed, colors.js, was also affected. Both of these open source libraries are foundational in front-end engineering. For instance, colors.js alone has over 20 million weekly downloads on npm (you could say almost every front-end developer uses it).

In 2020, Marak faced the predicament of his apartment burning down, leaving him homeless. The sponsorship he received from his open source projects was insufficient to cover his daily expenses, and his life became increasingly difficult. This led to his regrettable and desperate decision in early 2022.

_To expand on this, there are many different perspectives on this incident:_
_- Some argue that if you don't want big companies freeloading off your work, you should use copyleft licenses like GPL or even AGPL instead of the MIT License. The MIT License grants everyone the right to use your code freely from the start. However, whether the project would have achieved its current influence under GPL is another matter (commercial companies typically have legal teams review open source dependencies before release to ensure no GPL-licensed dependencies, as they would otherwise have to open-source their entire product)._
_- Others believe that the project, having evolved with contributions from countless open source contributors, is now a collective creation of the entire open source community. Therefore, no one has the right to turn everyone's hard work into "shit."_
_- There are also voices supporting Marak, such as those saying, "These parasites have been sucking our blood for too long; at least you made them feel the pain!"_
_- Some also approach it from a license perspective: while many have contributed code, legally speaking, since this was Marak's personal project under the MIT License, which grants all rights and absolves the author of any additional obligations, Marak is fully within his rights to do this._

There are many other similarly regrettable incidents. For example, Marak, the protagonist of the Faker.js incident, mentioned Aaron Hillel Swartz, a genius programmer who contributed to the early development of RSS and co-founded Reddit. He advocated for open knowledge and actively opposed internet piracy bills. True to his beliefs, he systematically downloaded academic journals from JSTOR using a guest account provided by his institution and made them publicly accessible. The U.S. federal prosecutor subsequently charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He rejected a plea deal offering six months in federal prison. Two days later, he was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment, having taken his own life.

Looking back, the open source spirit and open source software are among the most incredible phenomena of our time:

On one hand, the open source and free software movements are themselves extraordinary. Groups of intellectuals voluntarily dismantle their professional barriers, often acting against commercial logic to practice the ideal of "all for one, one for all" and universal harmony. Why? Because the world should be this way, for the prosperity of society as a whole, because it's cool, and because writing software itself brings immense joy to its creators—I remember thinking when I graduated: "Wow, I can get paid for writing code? My life is amazing!"

On the other hand, factually speaking, it's no exaggeration to say that open source software underpins the entire software industry today. The software industry has been utterly transformed by open source, to the point where MIT's famous introductory course 6.001—the renowned SICP (**S**tructure and **I**nterpretation of **C**omputer **P**rograms)—has been discontinued. Professor GJS stated: "Modern software engineering has become so complex that it resembles science more than engineering, as no one needs to build large systems from scratch anymore—and few have the ability to do so."

You might sigh and say, "Given how things have turned out, with idealists facing such circumstances, it's truly the disillusionment of ideals!"

**But is that really the case?**

## The Dynamics of Open Source Software

Idealism is admirable, but ideals must be rooted in reality to take hold and flourish. Let's invoke Bourdieu's sociological theory of "field-capital-habitus" to better explain this.

_[(Habitus) (Capital)] + Field = Social Practice_

Simply put, think of a socially constructed space (field) centered around a specific theme as a game, and each of us as players.

As players, although we often feel like free agents on an experiential level, the decisions we make daily are often based on predictable, prescribed behaviors and the attitudes of others—that is, a habitual strategy formed through interaction with the game itself (habitus).

Influenced by this habitus, we engage in games and struggles according to the rules of the game and our current position (capital), aiming to occupy a more advantageous position within the game.

This entire organic unity of subjective and objective elements constitutes (my highly simplified version of) Bourdieu's worldview for the social sciences.

Returning from the game metaphor to the real world, similarly, no one acts without some form of interest, and the goal of that action is likely to increase the capital they hold.

You might wonder: If that's the case, how do we explain altruistic behaviors, the spirit of dedication in fields like art and science, and the open source spirit discussed in this article?

According to Bourdieu's definition, capital is not merely economic capital but also includes symbolic capital, such as cultural capital and scientific capital. Recognizing different forms of capital, Bourdieu does not believe there are any purely disinterested actions in social production and practice. From a perspective akin to game theory, he argues that all human actions are based on calculations of some form of interest, aimed at acquiring some form of capital—if not the economic capital we typically think of.

In different fields, different forms of capital play dominant roles. For example, in academia, it's scientific capital; in art and culture, it's cultural capital. Different forms of capital in different fields have exchange rates, so we often see political or cultural elites leveraging their influence to acquire economic capital, and vice versa.

Here, I'd like to digress. The progressive aspect of Bourdieu's theory, in my view, is that all fields are created by humans, not emergent from human society. It explains why many phenomena are the way they are while also implying that seemingly entrenched ideas and social phenomena are not necessarily immutable. In other words, there is no purely normative "natural law" here, allowing for the possibility of overthrow and progress. History has not ended.

![image](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/08/27/the-end-of-the-history.jpeg)
_So you think history has ended? Let me tell you, the end of history has ended._

Returning to the topic, viewing the open source spirit through this theoretical framework can be explained as: In the field of open source software, hackers (note: Hackers—people who enjoy challenging problems through intelligence and creativity—not Crackers, who are computer criminals. The Chinese internet often conflates the two, stigmatizing the term "hacker") contribute open source code to the world to accumulate cultural capital, such as "reputation."

This is actually consistent with the gift culture often found in small hunter-gatherer groups before the advent of agricultural society. Supported by nature's abundant gifts, social relations were sustained by this gift culture, and tribal chiefs often engaged in public acts of charity. As the famous hacker culture anthology *The Cathedral and the Bazaar* states: In the field of open source software, there are no scarce "necessities of life." Early software was freely shared, and this material abundance meant that the only measure of success was reputation among peers.

But hacker culture and software did not remain confined to a small, resource-rich circle. Contrary to Professor von Neumann's prediction that "the world would need only about five computers," software is indeed "eating the world" today. This is good, indicating that software plays an irreplaceably huge role in human production and life. On the other hand, under the influence of capitalism, the penetration of the software industry into other sectors inevitably leads to the overlapping and merging of fields, forcing the industry to some extent to conform to the logic of the capitalist world. As computer technology and the software industry evolved from a small circle culture of well-off American middle-class hackers to become an indispensable part of global human production and life, the original core of the open source spirit was bound to be challenged.

Therefore, open source software was destined to move from its initial utopian, pastoral idyll belonging to a few technical elites to embrace the masses and the capitalist, commercial logic that sustains the world's 7 billion people.

Countless historical examples show that transitions from one mode of production to another are inevitably accompanied by pain. But as historical materialists, we do not view the progression from Athenian democracy in ancient Greek city-states to capitalism as a regression. On the contrary, it represents significant progress.

## The Current State of Open Source Software and Its Typical Business Models

Since Microsoft's infamous "Embrace, Extend, Extinguish" strategy strangled the then-star browser Netscape, winning the browser wars and leading to Netscape's rebirth as Mozilla Firefox (today's Firefox) and sparking the open source movement; to open source vendor RedHat's successful IPO in 1999; to today's "Microsoft Loves Linux" (TODO: image); and the proliferation of startups driven by open source software, I believe it's safe to say that, at least up to now, even after embracing the capitalist commercial logic it once "despised," the open source movement is far from failure.

![image](http://0xc1.space/images/2023/08/27/landscape.png)

However, open source software has indeed bifurcated into two distinct forms:

The first is the original, utopian first-generation open source software, born from hackers' own needs, written and open-sourced for other hackers to collaborate on. Examples like Vim, Emacs, Python, Linux, and PostgreSQL have stood the test of time and become iconic symbols of open source software, revered and celebrated.

I got into Emacs because I found Notion so useful that it made me reevaluate my documentation tools, leading to a question: Should I really entrust my lifelong note data to a commercial company that, while popular, likely won't outlive me? I then deliberately explored and started using Emacs' Org-mode for note-taking and task management, discovering that Org-mode is far superior to Notion for my needs. However, such needs are relatively niche. Human demands for software are more about solving current problems faster, better, and cheaper, giving rise to the second form of open source software.

The second is the newer, commercially driven open source software (and the companies behind them) that, besides practicing the "all for one, one for all" ideal, treat open source as a strategic consideration and market strategy. Examples today include MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Akka, RedHat, Ubuntu, GitLab, HashiCorp stack, and countless others. Around open source software, several proven, viable business models have emerged. Today's entrepreneurs don't even need to convince VCs familiar with open source why open source startups can succeed. For instance:

- Creating distributions or solutions around upstream core open source software, selling licenses or software subscription services for ease of maintenance or software availability guarantees. Examples include Ubuntu and RedHat for Linux, various public cloud Kubernetes container services, and public cloud database services (which led MongoDB to change its open source license to prohibit commercial competition after being "freeloaded").
- Offering basic features as free open source while keeping advanced commercial/team features proprietary and paid. Examples include GitLab, InfluxDB, Grafana, Envd/Modelz, and the HashiCorp Stack.
- Providing consulting services around complex, large-scale open source software like Linux, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and Prometheus.

The reason open source business models work is that source code does not equate to all the knowledge surrounding the software: including design philosophy, architectural evolution history, and, most importantly, operational knowledge for stable operation. This knowledge, crucial for upper-layer applications requiring stable operation, is often held only by core developers, forming the basis for commercialization.

For example, it's unrealistic for a company whose main business isn't public cloud services to build its own cloud infrastructure from scratch, starting with its own data centers, instead of using AWS or Alibaba Cloud services.

You might ask: Since the business is different and source code isn't a concern, does it even matter if the software is open source?

In these fields, if a commercial company tries to sell its proprietary software—say, an operating system compatible with POSIX interfaces—it will inevitably face skepticism: How is your software better than Linux, which has been tested for 30 years? Nowadays, no enterprise attempts to compete directly with Linux; instead, everyone focuses on differentiated aspects.

I am very excited about these changes in open source software and the software industry as a whole.
Why do I say that?

## Epilogue - People's History vs. Heroic History

Henrik, mentioned at the beginning of the article, is undoubtedly an heir to the utopian era of shining stars, an absolute hero in every sense. It was Henrik's doom-emacs that gave me, a Vim user, a foothold in the Emacs world and even provided a documentation writing experience far better than Notion. It was Henrik who led me to discover the amazing NixOS, finally freeing me from endless system configuration and painful rollbacks.

Although Henrik addressed the small stir around the Bus Factor by stating he would never abandon doom-emacs and promised to give the community an explanation, sooner or later, heroes will fade. When that time comes, what should we, who follow in the heroes' footsteps, do?

_The net is vast and infinite. I really like the ending where Motoko disappears into the network. The audience doesn't need Motoko as an idol, and Motoko doesn't need to bind herself with her ego._

In the documentation field, from the thriving community of Emacs/Org-mode, tools like LogSeq and startups (seed round: $4.1M) have emerged. In the shadow of Notion, open-source star teams like AFFiNE (Pre-A round funding in the tens of millions of dollars) have been born.

Similar phenomena are now proliferating across various sectors of the software industry, all built upon the solid infrastructure laid by generations of open source software and idealist predecessors. Industry giants can no longer easily monopolize entire sectors as they could two decades ago. I believe that further improvements
