"title": "Zola Blog Real-time Editing and Backend Solution Design Task List"
"summary": "This document is a design task list for integrating a WYSIWYG Markdown real-time editor and a Supabase/GitHub backend solution into a Zola blog. The document is divided into four main phases: Current State Audit & Constraints, Editor Selection Research, Backend & Data Model Design, and Integration Solution Detailed Design & Implementation Plan. Each phase contains specific tasks and acceptance criteria. All design tasks are currently completed and have entered the review stage. The document also lists the suggested MVP (Minimum Viable Product) scope, including core features such as the /admin page, Supabase table structure, editor integration, and publishing workflow, as well as v2 enhancements like image upload, version history, and multi-document management. Last updated on January 6, 2026."

# Zola Blog: WYSIWYG Markdown Real-time Editing + Supabase/GitHub Backend Solution Design - Task List

## Quick Status

**Current Phase**: Completed (Awaiting Review)
**Current Task**: Awaiting your review: Confirm editing scope / real-time meaning / publishing pipeline / authentication / image strategy (see `plan.md`)
**Progress**: 8/8 tasks completed (Design documentation ready)

---

## Phase 1: Current State Audit & Constraints ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Audit the existing theme/CSS variables, template structure, JS dependencies, and deployment method to clarify the design language and technical constraints that must be preserved. | Acceptance: Document the existing architecture, CSS tokens/variables, reusable components/page entry points, and points that should not be broken in `context.md`.
- [x] Clarify the meaning of "real-time editing" (real-time preview / auto-save / multi-user collaboration) and list questions requiring your review. | Acceptance: List unresolved issues and default assumptions in `plan.md`.

---

## Phase 2: Editor Selection Research ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Research embeddable WYSIWYG Markdown editors online (preferring 1-2 no-build/pure JS solutions + 1-2 React solutions), comparing features, size, customization/theming capabilities, image upload hooks, license, and integration complexity. | Acceptance: Write a comparison table and recommended candidates (with links) in `context.md`, noting points requiring verification/uncertainty.
- [x] Provide a UI/theming adaptation strategy consistent with the existing suCSS + CSS variable style (introducing no or minimal new design system). | Acceptance: Provide theming adaptation strategy and key implementation points (CSS variable mapping, dark mode, button/form styling) in `plan.md`.

---

## Phase 3: Backend & Data Model Design ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Design the Supabase solution: Auth, RLS, table structure, object storage (images), and frontend direct connection method; simultaneously provide the GitHub Issue/Discussion solution: authentication, permissions, write and sync strategies. | Acceptance: Write the data flow, permission models, threat points, and trade-off recommendations for both solutions in `context.md`.
- [x] Define the publish/sync path from "edit result" to "site content" (without writing a manual backend): e.g., GitHub Actions sync, client-side PR submission, or only as a draft repository. | Acceptance: Clearly define the recommended path, alternative paths, and their respective operational workflows in `plan.md`.

---

## Phase 4: Integration Solution Detailed Design & Implementation Plan ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Output the final recommended end-to-end design: page entry (`/admin`), routing/permissions, editor configuration, save/publish workflow, failure recovery, version history (optional). | Acceptance: Provide an executable step-by-step implementation plan (at the file/directory level) in `plan.md`, marking key decision points requiring your review.
- [x] List the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope and subsequent enhancements (image management, draft/publish, rollback, multi-user collaboration, etc.). | Acceptance: Provide MVP and v2 enhancements in checklist form in `tasks.md`.

## Newly Discovered Tasks

(None)

---

## MVP (Suggested Scope)

- [ ] `/admin` page: Reuse `reset.css`/`suCSS.css`/`style.css`, and integrate with the existing light/dark toggle (maintaining consistent styling).
- [ ] Supabase: Create `documents` table + RLS (single-user allowlist).
- [ ] Editor: Integrate Vditor (prioritizing IR/source mode as fallback), implement "open → edit → auto-save (debounce)".
- [ ] Front matter protection: Frontend splits front matter and body for storage/editing (avoiding WYSIWYG rewriting).
- [ ] Publish button: Writes `published_at` (or boolean) to distinguish "draft/published".
- [ ] GitHub Actions: Pull `published` documents from Supabase, sync write to `content/**`, commit to `master`, triggering site deployment.
- [ ] Conflict strategy: Default Supabase as source of truth; if manual repo changes are detected, fail-fast and prompt for manual handling.

## v2 (Enhancements)

- [ ] Image upload: Connect to Supabase Storage (drag-and-drop/paste upload), automatically insert external link Markdown.
- [ ] Version history: `document_revisions` table (diff/rollback), or retain rollback points in Git commits.
- [ ] Local preview consistency: Provide "preview according to Zola rendering rules" hints in `/admin` (at minimum: code highlighting, mermaid, shortcodes displayed as-is).
- [ ] Multi-document management: Tree-based browsing/searching/tagging according to `content/**`.
- [ ] Permission enhancements: Multi-user (collaborators) and audit logs.
- [ ] Publishing workflow enhancement: Generate PR instead of direct push, facilitating review.
